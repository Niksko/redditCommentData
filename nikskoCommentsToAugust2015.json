I think I'm going to give a running commentary, since this post is about a review after all.\n\n3 minutes in and we're off to a bad start. We've already got a cheesy green screen overlay explaining the now very thoroughly disproven origin of IPA where the hops were used as a preservative to get the beer to India.\n\n8 minutes in. Ok, still not going well. We've got kelp in the IPA, because of the sea air in San Diego. I can kind of get that. But now we've got the hottest chilli in the world, which just seems stupid. Why not just pick a really tasty chilli? We've also got a scene where the boys are teaching some grandmas about craft beer, and they're doing something which feels directly lifted from the most excellent Ralfy of [ralfystuff](http://www.youtube.com/user/ralfystuff) on Youtube. That's pretty low, though it might just be a coincidence.\n\n11 minutes. *Still* not going well. I can see why these guys make such ridiculous beers. The hosts are really childish in some ways. So far I prefer Brew Masters. At least Sam Calagione explained how to make beer, and had the maturity not to make nipple jokes.\n\n14 minutes. Nipple joke count is at 3. Not a good sign.\n\n17 minutes. The segment started well with some food and beer pairing type talk, and then veered off a cliff into a competition to win a date with a chef.\n\n17:30. Chef is actually pretty hot. At least they have good taste in women.\n\n20:50. Martin is striking me as the one with the better palate. James just described two beers in a row as 'cleansing your palate so that you can have that next bite' or something like that. No idea why he values this so highly when you're trying to pair with food.\n\n22:50. Another nipples. I'm sensing a theme here.\n\n26 minutes. Ok, some more education on the brewing process. This is getting better.\n\n28 minutes. Greg Koch is a funny guy and a good presenter. He should have a show instead of these two bozos.\n\n31 minutes: Hilarious! They just tried to convert some mean looking guy with tatts to craft beer. They give him a belgian strong ale and he says it reminds him of pruno, which is the alcohol they make in prison.\n\n35 minutes: The little old lady who is really amazed that beer can taste and smell so great is pretty cute.\n\n41 minutes: And we're at the end. The beer turned out alright, but from the sounds of it they probably overdid the chillis. We end with a bit of absurdly stupid TV faux-suspense, where just after everybody has told them that they really love the beer, the hosts ask everybody to yell 'Hell yeah' if they like the beer. We count to three and then there's a beat, and then the blindingly obvious happens and everybody yells.\n\nSo what are my overall impressions? It's a pretty good show, but it's frustrating because of the host's immaturity. I'll probably keep watching, but only if future episodes have interesting premises.\n\nOh, and this is going to get cancelled so fast it'll make your head spin, but it'll be nice while it lasts. It suffers from *exactly* the same problem as Brew Masters did, whereby you're just not capturing the attention of the mainstream audience. You're brewing with crazy things, and the average Bud drinker is going to turn it off because he wouldn't fucking touch a beer with kelp in it.\n\nThat being said, this does have two things going for it. Firstly, as much as I dislike the hosts and their mannerisms, the public will probably like it. Secondly, they've been smart and they've got a whole bunch of footage of \"average joes\" drinking outlandish beers and really enjoying it. This was kind of lacking on Brew Masters, so perhaps this will make it more relatable."}

I'm not sure about you, but I've met some teachers who are absolute dropkicks and who I definitely would not want teaching my son or daughter. Intelligent teachers are going to produce intelligent students.\n\nI also think the fact that their education system distinguishes between academic secondary school diplomas and vocational secondary school diplomas is quite important. There are a large number of students currently in upper secondary school who don't want to be their. They've decided that academic pursuits are not for them, and they'd rather take vocational training. Instead of attempting to shoehorn them into the regular schooling system, Finland attempts to separate them out. So instead of performing poorly and being a burden on their fellow students they're allowed to do what they want. I'm aware that vocational subjects exist in Australia, but it's usually on a school by school basis. For example, my secondary school didn't really offer them, and students who wanted to take vocational training needed to either change schools or attend TAFE classes outside of school hours.\n\nThere's also the fact that all schools in Finland are what we would consider \"public schools\" in Australia. There's something to be said for uniform education across all students, without some students getting special treatment because they have rich parents.\n\nFinally, Australia has absolutely rampant anti-intellectualism. I suspect this isn't the case in Finland. I guess that's slightly more qualitative and subjective, but it annoyed the fuck out of my going through highschool.\n\nThe fact that Australia and Finland are ranked equally in the UN's Human Development Index indicates that whether you prefer one system or the other is probably a personal preference, but I prefer the Finnish way."}

Likewise, just drinking a lot of wine doesn't mean you can actually tell the difference between them.\n\nI'm from Australia too, and my Dad is bottling 400L of wine on the weekend.

It's a fairly common thing in Australia. You drink hundreds of bottles of shiraz and cab sav and your really only get a very small slice of what wine has to offer. Partner that with the approach that you seem to have which is \"wine tasting is bullshit\", and nobody actually spends time assessing what they're drinking. It's almost a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe conclusion should be that this behaviour is broken, and that being able to pick flavours out of wine requires considerable effort. Not only do you need to have an excellent memory for flavours, but you need to spend time learning and concentrating.\n\nThere's also a bit of a cultural element to wine tasting. Sometimes everybody is talking about a flavour in a particular style, and you can't pick it. Sometimes it's because you don't know that food well enough, but other times it's because there isn't really a food with that taste, but it's close to a particular food and everybody gives it that name.\n\nIn the end, you are correct. Trust your palate and drink what you like. But beyond that, there are considerable nuances. Especially when you're making beer or wine or anything really, it's extremely helpful to be able to say \"that was great, but I didn't like this particular flavour\" and then to be able to do something about that.

I've had these people multiple times for multiple things, and each time I come away not understanding the subject. Some of these lecturers have been teaching for many many years, and the fact that they're still lecturing after all of this time is baffling to me. Either make them take a diploma of education or scrutinise them more closely in their early years of lecturing to determine whether they are effective communicators or not.

{"created_utc":"1382085109","score":"14","subreddit":"Android","body":"The pure Android experience is all about using Android the way that Google intended.\n\nWhat that boils down to is a piece of hardware that Google has its hand in designing, coupled with stock Android software.\n\nOn the hardware side, you've got a number of features that Google feels are best for the end user. These are:\n\n* No SD card. This is a huge reason why many people refuse to buy a Nexus device. Google have made the decision to not allow expandable memory on Nexus devices because of some technical reason I don't quite understand, but essentially it's that it complicates the filesystem to have apps stored in two different places.\n* Onscreen buttons. Google likes them (presumably) because you can change them based on circumstance and because they rotate with the display and hide themselves when not needed. I like them, some people don't. Personally, it gives the hardware a really slick look because the front of the device is completely devoid of any markings or logos.\n* Not necessarily the latest internals, but fairly high end internals, possibly with some interesting new features. For example, the Nexus devices since the Nexus S have had NFC. The Nexus 5 is rumoured to have an always listening core.\n\nHowever the hardware is usually pretty uninteresting. Most people don't like the hardware because of lack of expandable storage. Also the Nexus device are notorious for having pretty average cameras, although this looks like it might change with the Nexus 5. That's all fine, but personally I think the benefits in software outweigh the minor hardware downsides.\n\nFirstly, the Nexus devices are sold with their bootloaders easily unlocked. This makes flashing ROMs really easy, and you get easily the best and widest range of developer support. Major custom roms like AOKP or Paranoid Android often release first for Nexus devices, and you can be basically guaranteed that your device will remain compatible into the future.\n\nSecondly, if you get the device directly from Google, you get software updates as soon as they're released, for 2 years at least (possibly more, we'll see if the Galaxy Nexus gets 4.4). You're always on the latest version. Even though updates since 4.0 have been pretty incremental, this is still important because of under-the-hood improvements that can't be decoupled from the OS like Google has been doing with its apps.\n\nMost importantly though, you're running stock Android. Google have come into a great UI designer in Matias Duarte, and stock Android is looking absolutely gorgeous. Others may disagree, but I feel that every single custom skin out there detracts from the simplicity and beauty that is stock Android. So when you buy a Nexus device, you haven't got crazy bloatware or strange color schemes ruining what is a beautifully designed OS. Pure, simple, beautiful, stock Android.\n\nThis last point is the thing I'm most passionate about. For years Android has been looked down upon as the uglier cousin of iOS, and up until ICS that assessment was basically correct. But since ICS, Android gets more beautiful with every update, and I feel like it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The UI is simple, great looking and easy to understand and use, and OEM customisation screws that up. Why should I spend good money to buy a device whose software has essentially been crippled in both the usability and appearance department, simply for the sake of differentiation? Many arguments are made about extra features present in custom skins, but I see no reason why these can't be included without changing fundamental ways that Android works or uglifying the look and feel of the OS.\n\nThe reason I feel that last point is important is kind of a psychological reason. People love Apple products because they have a consistent and beautiful design language throughout their products. People get accustomed to the way iOS and OSX work, and they come to appreciate, respect and rely on it. This exact same thing has happened to me with Nexus devices, but it doesn't happen when you've got ugly and inconsistent styling that appears in custom skins. It's about brand loyalty and brand awareness for Android, which is good for everybody.\n\nEvery time you see somebody with a Samsung or HTC device who doesn't even know what Android is, or doesn't realise you can install apps, they're hurting the entire ecosystem. There's a reason why developers are *still* releasing first for iOS, or otherwise neglecting Android despite Android having 80ish% of the smartphone market. It's because most if not almost all iOS users *know* they're running iOS (well, they don't know what it's called, but there's less confusion because it's only iPhones running it). Having a consistent and unified layout, look and feel helps to cement the Android brand in consumer's minds, and increases awareness and developer support for everybody.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n* Almost cutting edge hardware with interesting features that Google thinks should be in more phones.\n* Stock Android, beautiful and free of bloat or skins, which is important for promoting brand awareness and general ecosystem wellbeing.\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\n"}

That gives us 1L of alcohol or 17.1 mol.\n\nNow if we assume that yeast produces one molecule of CO2 for every molecule of ethanol (which is true for glucose catabolism, but probably not true for the sugars in beer. Regardless, it's probably a good enough estimate) then that would give 423L of CO2 at 25C and 1 atm, which amounts to 3.5L/hour assuming 5 days of fermentation.\n\nAccording to some Googling, the average dorm room size is 12'x19' for two people, so if OP is in such a dorm, assuming 8' ceilings then the total volume of air in the room is about 73000L.\n\nSo after all the beer in OPs room has fermented and if we assume that none of the CO2 escapes and it displaces the air already in the room, then you'd have a CO2 concentration of about 2.75%. Apparently the LD50 of CO2 for a one hour exposure is 10%, so that's getting there. However since CO2 is heavier than air, it would likely sink so you wouldn't inhale as much.\n\nSo basically, you're probably fine.

Are they all equally good but just have different features? Is the Xperia J a current phone, or is it last year's model? All questions that have no definite answer based on the name of the device.\n\n&gt; Samsung Galaxy SIV\n\nOk, so it's part of the Galaxy line. This is a start, but is the Galaxy line better than the Ace line or the Note line? You can't tell from the name. Also the S is stupid and it doesn't need to be there any more.\n\n&gt; HTC One, HTC One X\n\nThis is the most egregious of all namings, because the One X is last years model but the One is this years.\n\n&gt; HTC One mini, Galaxy SIV mini\n\nDon't do this, because it easily fools consumers. A friend of mine recently came to me wanting to buy the HTC One mini because it seemed like a good size (he uses an iPhone) and the One was too big. He didn't realise that the One mini is not well specced compared to the One. It's things like this that give Android a bad name, because at least if somebody deliberately buys a cheap phone, you can blame that for their performance issues. But when HTC *deliberately markets* the One mini as \"just a smaller One\" and then the performance is shit, it's much less easy to blame their performance problems on poor purchasing because the manufacturer themselves is basically advertising this device to you in the capacity that you bought it: a high specced phone, just smaller. (Side note: he ended up ordering a Nexus 5 after seeing mine :D)\n\n**People who do it right, or who have done it right in one instance**\n\nGoogle - Nexus 7 2013 is perfect. It's the Nexus 7. It's not last year's model, it's the 2013 model.\n\nGoogle - Nexus 5 is after Nexus 4. If we get a Nexus 5 (2014) next year I'll be a happy man.\n\nApple - As usual, they've had this figured out for a while. All of their products are now &lt;product name&gt; (year), except for the iPhones which still have numbers, but they follow an extremely logical progression. Admittedly it's a slightly easier problem for them, because up until this year they only had one line of iPhones. Now that they've got two, they've sort of backed themselves into a hole by naming the 5C. What do we get next year? Do we get an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6C? After that do we get an iPhone 6S and an iPhone 6SC? It's *a* solution but not really the best one.\n\nSamsung and HTC and everyone else are in a very different position, because they have like 10123904127 different phones and lines. However there's definitely still room for a logical product lineup. Apple have done this with their computers. You have the Macbook Air, the Macbook Pro, the iMac and the Mac Pro. Except for the iMac, all of the *names themselves* give you an idea as to what the device is meant for. Air is light, Pro is for power, Macbook means a laptop.\n\nSamsung's devices all now seem to fall under the Galaxy line, but within this there is S, Note, Tab, Active, Pocket, Mega, Ativ, Fame, and probably millions of others. Now Active, Tab, Mega, and Pocket all kind of make sense, but I'd argue that Note, S, Ativ and Fame don't. Note and S are probably their biggest sellers, so it should stand to reason that their names are self evident. You might argue that Note makes sense, but really the point of these phones are that they're large, not necessarily that they can take notes (although that is a key component).\n"}

Came in pretty hugely under gravity (didn't account for low efficiently when brewing high gravity), then I'm 99% sure that I didn't screw on the lid of my fermentor properly (it was new, wasn't used to screwing it up) so I think the beer got pretty oxidised. Tasted very vegemitey for a while, I was really kind of bummed. However it's steadily gotten better in the intervening time, and the bottle I had today was really really wonderful.\n\nSecondly, the batch the I've got on the go at the moment is probably the most shambolic. It's supposed to be a berliner weisse with lacto, brett and S-04. I made a brett starter first (just a little one), no problem. Then I tried to make a lacto starter. I figured if I heated it I could just make it overnight and that would be enough to get it going. Realised the next day when the apple juice starter just tasted like apple juice that the lacto I pitched was probably dead. I probably should have postponed the brew, but I'm almost running out of hombrew so I went ahead anyway.\n\nIn the end I just added a few hundred grams of unmilled pils to serve as lacto innoculant. My plan was to ferment at 18C with the lacto for 24 hours, then add brett and S-04. That went out the window, because I wasn't satisfied I had any sort of lacto starter, and I was worried that my wort would get something nasty if I just left it until I had a decent lacto starter or with the unmilled grain itself. So I decided to cool the wort to 49C and then add the unmilled grain. Of course like an idiot I chilled right down to 49C, then by the time I had transferred the wort to the carboy it was more like 30C. No worries, put a heating belt around it. Heating belt barely did anything. Wrapped it in towels. That sort of helped, but it still only got up to 42C after 24 hours of solid heating.\n\nBut despite all of the screw ups, it was smelling and tasting really cleanly sour today, and so I went ahead an chilled it and pitched my brett and S-04. Chilling it was also a shambles, because for some reason I decided that if I just wrapped the fermenter in a wet blanket and left it outside in the 10C cold with some wind, I would get some sort of fast cooling swamp cooler thing happening. After attempting that for an hour or two I came to my senses and went and bought a bag of ice to take the temp down.\n\nBasically, shambles of a batch, but I'm actually reasonably confident that it will turn out fine. It's also really highlighted how shitty some of my processes are."}

I find the fruitiness of the hops and the medium carbonation help to refresh you while complimenting some of those chilli flavors.\n\n* Sours with rich, fatty foods. Anything that you'd consider fatty like pork belly, fatty cured meats, fatty sauces, I feel they go well with acidic drinks because the acid helps to cut some of the fat and stops your palate being overwhelmed. This is along the same lines as pairing an acidic white wine with fatty foods.\n\n* Heavy beers with desserts. The sweetness goes well the heaviness of the beer.\n\n* Matching flavor notes. Having a plum pudding for dessert? Pick something with plum notes like a Belgian dark beer. Salad with orange in it? Perhaps something hoppy with lots of orange. Steak? A stout brewed with peppercorns is divine.\n\nSomething I've always wanted to try is Berliner weisse with McDonalds (or really any fatty fast food). Blasphemy, but I think it would work. The sourness would cut the fat like I've said. I'm making a Berliner weisse right now, so we'll see how it goes in a few months time.\n\nLastly, I 100% disagree with David Chang. Macro lagers have no place with good food. If you want something light and refreshing, pick up a properly made lager, a table beer, a session pale ale or a Berliner weisse. There are plenty of ways to have a light, palate cleansing beer that isn't Bud Light."}

Little things like that make on screen buttons heaps more versatile than capacitive keys.\n\nThe issue with gaming is simply that game developers need to avoid putting controls down the bottom of the game that you're likely to hit when playing.

If we're all attempting to achieve a steak that's tender, rare on the inside, browned on the outside, there really isn't much debate as to the method.\n\n&gt; First, marinade preferably overnight, but a couple of hours before is okay too. Look at recipes online and choose what you like, read the reviews though sometimes there are tips from others. My favorite is: equal parts teriyaki and whiskey (1/2 c. each), 1 Tb garlic juice, and 1 Tb. Brown sugar. Do not salt them! It dehydrates the meat.\n\nMarinades are fine, but why on a steak? Steak is so flavorsome as it is (especially if you got a nice quality one), you shouldn't need a marinade. As I said, I love marinated meat. But marinate stuff other than expensive steak.\n\n&gt; Brush the grill with a little oil or butter before you put them to help with grill marks. \n\nButter will probably burn. Ditto something like olive oil. Vegetables oils are good because of the high smoke point, safflower or peanut is even better.\n\n&gt; Then add kosher salt and cracked pepper.\n\nSalt is fine. Lots is good advice. Pepper is alright, but if you've got the grill really really hot (like you should have) then the pepper will scorch and go bitter.\n\n&gt; You can look up a chart online for cooking times. I do 4 min on the first side and 2 on the second.\n\nThis will vary waaaaaaay too much depending on the heat of your grill or the thickness of your steak. Going by feel or the foolproof temperature probe is much safer.\n\n&gt; Also, I only take them out of the fridge 10 minutes before.\n\nBad idea. By the time you get the center to a high enough temperature, the outside will be overcooked.\n\n&gt;  can't speak for any other method besides grilling, but turning every 20 seconds (I don't think) seems like a bad idea. They might not brown properly.\n\nAgreed. They might not. In that case, your grill wasn't hot enough. Your goal is to get the centre to the desired temperature while thoroughly browning the outside. Turning often allows the meat to cook more evenly. If you've ever wondered why chefs can get the inside of a steak to be a completely uniform pink color, while the inside of your steak has a more pronounced gradient from brown through grey to pink in the middle, it's because of the turning."}

It's pretty clear that the goal here is to trick consumers into buying their beer, otherwise they would just market them under the already existing brands.\n\nIt doesn't affect me much, because I know which brands are producing good beer and which aren't. But it saddens me a little when somebody posts about this great new craft beer that they've tried, which is really just the same old bland, flavourless crap with fancy packaging and an exotic sounding style. These are the people who are really hurt by this. The people who have the initiative and the drive to try and explore some of the really great beer that's out there, but end up going for something that's really the same as before through trickery and lack of public awareness.\n\nI think the problem that craft beer faces in Australia is that the public isn't making an informed decision. Joe consumer, even if he doesn't care, realises that wine comes in varying qualities, and that the sky is the limit on both price and quality. But I'd argue that in Australia, Joe consumer doesn't realise that exactly the same thing can be said for beer. The fact that there is some beer that is being marketed as being of higher quality, but then is of negligible difference only muddies the waters further.\n\nJoe consumer isn't an idiot, he's just uninformed. It's not that the general public can't discern the difference between crappy beer and great beer, it's that they don't even realise the two categories exist.\n\nPart of the problem is that craft beer in Australia is ABSURDLY expensive compared to places like the US. But the only way that price is going to come down is either an excise reform (pretty unlikely) or an economies of scale type increase in production and associated decrease in price. For every bottle of cheap, crappy fake craft beer that's bought, it's one less sale for the true craft breweries and a little more time before it becomes cheaper to drink good quality beer.\n"}

{"created_utc":"1377659008","score":"1","subreddit":"Homebrewing","body":"Other people have probably covered some of this, but here's some comments.\n\n* Recipe looks good.\n* As far as I'm aware, mashout isn't strictly necessary in homebrew applications. There was a Beersmith podcast where the guest explained that in commercial breweries, because scheduling might mean that the mash sits for a while before being lautered, a mashout is required in order to ensure that the wort doesn't undergo any unwanted conversion while it's sitting. This is not the case for homebrewing since we begin lautering almost immediately. It's not going to hurt, but it won't really do much either.\n* If you're using bottle water and you're brave enough, find a water profile calculator online and add some minerals. For an amber ale I'd say around 70ppm Ca, 20ppm Mg, 100ppm HCO3 and 100ppm S04. But make sure you read a little on water chemistry so you understand these additions. How to Brew has some great information. If you're incredibly confused like I was about when to add the minerals, the answer (I think) is to just add them to your mash. So after you've doughed in and started the timer, add the salts.\n* Yes, 100% definitely absolutely use boiling water to get to your desired mash temp. The temperature of my mash was a little low (3-4C) on my last two batches, and I figured adjusting wasn't worth the effort. Both of them had FGs about 3 points lower than I wanted. It didn't ruin them (in fact, it probably made the IPA better) but it means you're getting a drier beer with slightly less body.\n* Batch sparge at 175F, but not over. Heat it more than that and you might extract tannins.\n* Long sparge times are only for fly sparging. When you're batch sparging, you can drain the wort as fast as your system allows ie. as fast as you can without getting a stuck sparge."}

By virtue of the fact that Android runs on many different devices, the systems for optimising apps for different screen sizes is very robust. But to say that the idea of optimising for a form factor is 'foreign' is wrong. This is precisely the reason why we're having this discussion in the first place. You do need to optimise for tablets, but also other devices. Thankfully it's much easier on Android than on iOS from what I've heard. Or at least, it's easier than it would be to tailor iOS apps for the number of devices that Android has.\n\nThe third point is pretty off topic. Yes, there are some Android exclusive apps, or apps that can only work because of the openness of Android. But as much of an Android fanboy as I am, most of these apps don't matter to a 95% of users. Titanium Backup is great. The interface is horrible and it's really only useful to ROM addicts.

The general wisdom is that flavor and aroma additions should happen very late, quite possibly just after flameout. I've read a few times that adding hops in the last few minutes of the boil gives a wider range of flavors and aromas because the compounds have a little time to interact and volatilise and decompose, but not so much time that they completely decompose or volatilise.\n\nOutside of that, if you've got access to a gas chromatograph, a few years free and need a PhD topic, your question might serve well."}

The fact is, Facebook has fallen behind. It's a single service that does what it does poorly. Google+ has waaaay more features, looks nicer, and is integrated with basically every Google service. If you already use Google's services, why not use Google+?\n\nBut this doesn't really address the problem. What you mean is, \"none of my friends are there\". Yes, this is frustrating. But unless you're really good at pruning your Facebook friends list then there are probably a huge number of people on Facebook who you don't like or post stupid stuff constantly. Google+ makes it much easier to have meaningful conversations because the signal to noise ratio is much higher. Yes, it sucks when you want to share images with your family and friends and they're not on there, but the only way they will come is if **you** start using it.\n\n* You have to use your real name\n\nDoes this even need rebutting? Google+ makes it easy to control who sees what you post. If you don't want anybody associating stupid shit you do with your real name then either don't do stupid shit or don't share stupid shit publicly.\n\n* It's being forced on me\n\nAgain, what is the problem? You already have a Google account if you use Android. There's no extra setup beyond that. You just sign in and you get a whole bunch of benefits with no downsides.\n\nIn summary, Google+ is here to stay. It's not going to disappear, and Google have made it quite clear that they intend for it to be the social layer that glues together all of their services. And if you actually take a moment to give it a try, you'll find that it does a damn good job of connecting Google's services.\n\nIf you hate social, that's fine. If you hate integration, that's fine too. But otherwise, give Google+ a go and you'll see that it's actually really awesome.\n\nEDIT: Was so busy ranting I forgot to say that I agree about SMS integration. I use GTalk already, and just from chatting this evening I'm already loving the new UI. It's beautiful. But it pains me so much that this isn't just the stock messaging UI.\n\nI've got my fingers and toes crossed that when Google unveils 4.3 in a few days/weeks then they's reveal that Hangouts is the new stock messaging app. It's got the SMS permissions in there. Otherwise, a million karma to the first dev who can hack SMS into Hangouts."}

There's no data shared with the website about what other services you're using. None. It just serves as an account to associate your data with.\n\n&gt; And that's because the whole point for them is to try to learn as much as they can about me to give me advertisement. I just don't like it. It's sleazy.\n\nYes, Google will openly admit that they use data to serve you ads. It's how they make their money. Would you prefer that Youtube, Google Drive, Gmail and search all cost money to use? If you're creeped out by ads, then use an adblocking program.\n\nAt the same time, did you ever stop and consider that maybe Google is trying to do you a favor? Did you watch Larry Page's speech? He basically said that Google wants to make your life easier. Isn't that a noble goal? By collecting data on you they're not only able to serve you targeted ads (which I'd prefer to random ads on the off chance that I'm interested in them [if I ever saw ads, thank you Adblock]) but they're also able to do cool things like Google Now.\n\nFrankly, if you feel 'weird' or 'strange' or 'creeped-out' by Google having access to your data then you're a moron. Your data is stored securely in servers and the data is read by computers and interpreted according to algorithms. I'm not sure if you realise, but when you type 'how can I make a tinfoil hat to protect me from evil Google' into a search bar it's a computer giving you results. There isn't a little man who reads your query, has a laugh about it, faps to the photos of your mum that you uploaded to G+ and then gives you what you want.\n\nFeeling creeped-out by Google having your data is equivalent to being creeped-out that the phonebook has access to your phone number, except Google wont give out your name and phone number just because somebody opened it to the right page."}

As soon as you get an update, that's a few more months that you're not going to bother buying a new phone because you're on the latest version of the OS. Yes, some manufacturers are updating devices to ICS. In case you haven't heard we're now a full year on from ICS.\n\nSecondly, the former head of Motorola Sanjay Jha said explicitly that it was in fact carriers who want skins. They ask for skins because the average consumer isn't savvy enough to choose between phones purely on specs, and regardless, carriers don't want to sell 50 different phones that look identical to then average consumer. Adding a skin is a differentiator, and carriers like this.\n\nThirdly, skins are just extra software. Any extra software has to be made to work and tested with new OS versions, and hence, will necessarily increase time in porting the OS to a device. Take out skins and all you have to worry about is making the OS run on the hardware.\n\nLastly, I hope you're not confused about my position. Sure, ICS is going to be on loads of devices in the near future, and hence, there will be loads of devices with Chrome. But were a year on from ICS, and adoption is still very low.

For example, I could have one that automatically ssh's into my fileserver to save me the time of typing out the command all the time. I've seen this one done and it can also be made to automatically input your username and password. I could either stick them in spots where I frequently need to use the shortcut, or I was thinking I could put them on credit card sized cards and label them.\n* (This one may not be entirely possible) I think that even though the NFC chip in your credit card sends out an encrypted signal, it's still detectable as an NFC signal by your phone, so you can set up your phone to take you to your online banking hub just by tapping your phone to your wallet. Again, not sure about this one.\n\nIdeally, if everyone in my household had an NFC enable phone you could use it as a quick and convenient way of leaving messages for each other.

Lastly, people are so used to this burnt, horrible coffee that they don't complain about it because they just assume that 'that's how coffee tastes'.\n\nAll of this means that unless you go to a cafe that specialises in coffee, you'll probably get pretty awful coffee.

{"created_utc":"1340173804","score":"3","subreddit":"beer","body":"I think you definitely can. I'm not so sure that **I** can taste the subtle differences, but I'll give you a few reasons why I think other people can.\n\nAt the end of the day, a particular taste is just some chemicals interacting with the receptors in your nose, and some hints about sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness and umami from your taste buds. The only way we can recognise different tastes is because we've been told from a young age that 'this is an apple'. Then when you taste the apple, you're creating a memory of that combination of stimuli and then associating it with the concept of 'apple flavour' (I'm not really an expert in this area, so this may be inaccurate, but you get the idea).\n\nHuman taste and smell are also very sensitive. You can definitely taste the difference between different types of apple (or at least, some people can. Human taste is also pretty variable among people). So to me, it's entirely possible that if you have a sensitive enough palate, then you can taste the difference between a beer that tastes like golden-delicious apples and a beer that tastes of granny-smith apples.\n\nBut aside from variability in our ability to taste and smell, I think the main reason 99% of people don't taste these subtleties is because we haven't trained ourselves to taste them. If a taste is just a memory of some stimuli, how can you taste something in a food if you haven't taken the time to 'make a memory' of that taste? You can't know what a truffle smells or tastes like without smelling or tasting it. And when flavours become more subtle (such as the difference between two apple varietals) then I'd wager that you need to spend more time taking note of the differences before you can identify them. I wouldn't be able to pick granny-smith apple flavour because I haven't taken the time to really savour granny-smith apples, notice the differences in flavour between other apples and remember them. However, I can taste apple flavour (as different from peach flavor) because I've eaten so many (while knowing that I'm eating an apple) that I can remember the flavour.\n\nIf you're skeptical about beverage reviewers making stuff up, go and watch a few episodes of wine library tv. I know wine and beer are different beasts (although Gary does do a few episodes on beer tastings) but once you get to know the presenter you'll see that he clearly isn't bullshitting. He sincerely believes all the flavors that he's tasting. He also does an [episode on exactly what I'm talking about above](http://tv.winelibrary.com/2006/12/15/how-to-get-your-wine-palate-trained-episode-148/). In it he 'educates his palate' by basically trying heaps of foods whose tastes often crop up in wines he is drinking. That way, when it comes up you can actually recognize it.\n\ntl;dr No, it's not just bullshit. You can only taste something once you've taken the time to 'memorise' it's flavour."}

I've got friends who just put a letter on the top of the cap, but that's annoying to me because you have to constantly recall what letter corresponds to which batch. Also, it's much harder to give them as a gift because then you're inextricably tied to explaining what the beer is.\n\nI've also been picking up some colored caps lately (red, green, white etc.) and that's been useful because if I bring a few to a friend's house I can say \"the green caps are the saison, the red caps are the pale ale\".\n\n&gt; I am overdue on bottling a whiskey barrel stout. It has been fermenting since mid March and I added the whiskey barrel chips on April 4th. Is this bad?\n\nSounds like it'll be a tasty beer. I left an imperial stout that I put bourbon barrel oak chips into for about 3 weeks on oak, and overall fermentation time was 3 months. It's tasting great now about a year later, but it needs time to settle and mellow. But yeah, bottle when you can, there's really no hurry."}

The author criticizes Android for being difficult to use in different iterations, where as the iPhone 4s is immediately usable to a iPhone 3g user. OEM skins aside, this is a flawed comparison, because Google's way is to release something and then polish it, while Apple releases the finished product and then improves it in minor ways. Both methods are valid and have their upsides and downsides.\n\nI do agree that Android has an issue with marketing, but I don't think there's a clear cut way to solve it.\n\nThe author suggests unifying the UX across all devices, which I agree with from a consumer standpoint, but won't work from a manufacturers point of view. The issue is that if you remove custom skins (which I hate as much as the next person) the only thing left to differentiate products is the hardware specs, and it's evident that consumers either don't care or don't understand enough about these figures to be able to make informed decisions.\n\nThe ultimate solution is to unify the OS into one version which is the same on every device, but there isn't yet a solution that will both appease manufacturers and end users."}

I also got really poor efficiency, I suspect because my sparging wasn't very good.\n\nFor my second batch, I decided to to AG. I built a simple bucket in bucket lauter tun out of a two buckets and assorted tubing, drill bits and plumbing parts for about $50. I found an old cooler in my shed to mash in, but you could very easily use the lauter tun I made for the mash as well.\n\nEverything went really smoothly, and it's currently out of primary and cold crashing for a few days before I dry hop it (a tip I picked up from [the Mad Fermentationist](http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2011/09/galaxy-hopped-double-ipa.html)).\n\nSo basically, that's a round about anecdotal way of saying that you should just fork out the $50 to build a mash/lauter tun.

{"created_utc":"1371515258","score":"4","subreddit":"beer","body":"Ooooh. Awesome question.\n\nSo basic requirements for this are pretty straightforward. You want 5 styles that try and cover the gamut of beers out there, and you want a beer for each style that is reasonably stereotypical of the style.\n\nAnother requirement that I'm going to impose on myself is that all of the beers be *somewhat* easy to find (in Australia) so that I'm not showing this hypothetical person beers that are unobtainable.\n\nOff we go:\n\n* Firstly, I'd pick a Pale Lager. I want to move from the known to the unknown, and Pale Lagers are the beer style most people are familiar with. For this I'd pick **2 Brothers Kung Foo Rice Lager**. It's clean, it's got some nice orange hop character and it's a really easy drinking and flavoursome beer without being too different to what they may have already tried.\n* Second, a hefeweizen. Great style of beer, with a unique flavour profile. It also introduces you to the whole world of wheat beers. I'd pick **Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier** because it's basically the definition of a hefeweizen.\n* Third, an IPA. Hugely popular at the moment, and a great opportunity to introduce hop flavours and aroma. **Sierra Nevada Torpedo** is actually pretty easy to get over here, so that's an option. As for something local, **Mountain Goat IPA** is pretty wonderful as well.\n* Fourth, something Belgian. Again, introducing new flavours and aromas. **Chimay Blue** would work well.\n* Lastly, a stout. Again, **Sierra Nevada Stout** is reasonably easy to find here as is **Young's Double Chocolate Stout**, but something local would be **Grand Ridge Hatlifter Stout**.\n\nThose would be my choices. 5 beers that are reasonably stereotypical of their styles and cover a wide range of flavours and aromas.\n\nIf you lift the restriction of the beers being easy to get then it's a completely different game. For the record I'd probably still go with the Pale Lager and the Hefeweizen, but after that I'd go with some sort of gigantic double IPA to show what hops can really do, then a saison or a sour to get that funk going and finally a smoked dark beer. Mikkeller/Stillwater's Rauchstar was pretty good. Although this menu might be a little better for somebody who's interested in craft beer but wants to dive right in rather than a complete novice."}

{"created_utc":"1401411047","score":"4","subreddit":"australia","body":"&gt;  Hahahahaha scientific fact. For a mathematician, he sure is sloppy with his rigorous proofs. Anyone with a basic understanding of logic knows that science doesn't deal with absolute truth or absolute facts. In fact, arguing that there is such a thing as scientific fact is completely contrary to the argument he is trying to make for the need to achieve truth through reasoning. By asserting scientific fact he is essentially saying that something is true because it is scientific, which is just as much a faith based system of belief as anything you will get from religion.\n\nScience is most definitely not faith based. The difference is that if you were so inclined, you could follow back the reasoning to axioms, and you can show that your models fit reality through repeated experimentation. And no, not many people actually do experiments to verify that gravity works the way that it is presented in textbooks. But you could. That's the difference. This argument is interesting to think about for a little while, and then you leave it to the philosophers because contemplating that 'perhaps tomorrow gravity will stop working' doesn't really lead to many non-philosophical conclusions.\n\nAnd Burkhard knows about this little quirk of science. The dude is a fucking genius. It's just difficult to argue points about science if you have to spend 10 paragraphs talking about why we can't technically prove anything but regardless we're really really sure.\n\n&gt; How are you meant to meaningfully teach highschoolers about the vast number of theories and models that make up climate science, when most postgraduates in the field struggle with that material? \n\nWhat are you basing this off of? I took a few atmospheric science subjects as part of my undergrad. Not only did I understand the concepts being taught, but not at any point did I get any feeling that my lecturers and tutors didn't understand how climate science worked. I think you're projecting your own inability to understand climate science. The people who study this for a living and write papers about this understand what's happening.\n\nTo the larger point of how you teach the general public about science, it's definitely tricky. I'm of the opinion that you need to provide them with an appreciation for what science has achieved, and for how those achievements have been made. It's difficult, but the reason you and I accept climate science is because we understand the methods used to come to those conclusions, and we understand that if we were to devote some time to it, we could understand it as well.

The elective subjects included 'Glorious Games (some basic games programming in a language called GameMaker)', 'Business Boosters (which explored marketing of a product)', some sort of fashion subject and a few others dealing with golbalisation, environmentalism and production of a soap opera. The compulsory modules were basic sex ed, writing an short powerpoint presentation about yourself, a website made in dreamweaver and 9UP (9 urban project, which got students to go into the city and conduct surveys in order to determine the validity of a hypothesis of your choice eg. that one particular newspaper was more popular than another).\n\nAll of the above subjects 'worked', but to varying degrees. Some were simply an excuse to fuck around, others actually were stimulating (9UP in particular). The main issue was that teaching subjects like marketing, fashion and programming at a high school level is quite difficult, and so you end up learning almost nothing because it's hard to teach complicated subjects to people of that age.\n\nSo the teaching method you described works sometimes, doesn't other times, but mainly just needs time to get established.\n\nJust some of my opinions after having gone through the system."}

Most people don't even realise there is a micro usb male to usb female cable, much less actually have one.\n\n&gt; Being able to make a physical backup without rooting the device\n\nThis one is fair enough.\n\n&gt; An iTunes like central app that lets you automatically sync all your movies/tv shows/audiobooks/podcasts/ringtones/books and even music. Google music unfortunately only allows mp3, which means inferior quality than physically syncing your iTunes library. I mean I hate iTunes because syncing multiple devices can be a hassle, but I realised that I take iTunes for granted once I switched to android. Like I have to sync and keep track of all my media manually, whereas iTunes took care of everything\n\nThe average user doesn't care about music quality. You upload your music to Google Music and you're done.\n\n&gt; A lighter OS. Android is still a bit too dark.\n\nSubjective\n\n&gt; Powerful media apps like iMovie, GarageBand or iPhoto. Google ought to offer something similar. There is nothing that compares to them in the play store\n\nCan easily be provided by third parties. Also, Google isn't in the business of movie editing or photo editing, and when they are they've shown that they prefer to just automatically fix your photos for you, automatically sort them, automatically pick the good ones etc. This is preferable for 99% of users.\n\n&gt; Better standby time. Vanilla, untouched android should be on par with iOS in terms of power management. So I can forget about charging my nexus 7 and don't have to worry about switching off wifi because else it loses 10% per night, whereas the iPad only loses 1%\n\nValid criticism.\n\n&gt; I think google could and should incorporate a lot of cyanogenmod features the same way apple takes jailbreak features and builds them into the OS. Being able to add/subtract icons to/from the onscreen button tray seems like a great place to start\n\nYou mean all of those power user features that regular users wouldn't even realise were there?\n\n&gt; A better mail app. I still don't understand why replying to a mail is so primitive, give me the whole screen estate google, not a single line\n\nI'm assuming you're talking about the mail app. Google wants you to use Gmail, so that's where their effort goes. If you're talking about Gmail, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Gmail reply seems fine to me.\n\n&gt; Polish, if there is one thing google needs to focus on its polishing android, it isn't as nearly polished as iOS, but it ought to be.\n\nDisagree on this. Android has been pretty polished since at least 4.3\n\n&gt; Onscreen notifications and better notification management. You can't sort notifications per app a la iOS right? It's always the most recent one.\n\nI don't understand why you want this. Onscreen notifications are superfluous when they're in your notification tray anyway. Why do you need to sort your notifications? You just act on them, leave them or swipe them away.\n\n&gt; Built in dictionary\n\nI guess so. What for though? If it's for looking up word definitions, google it.\n\nPower users need to realise that they're not the primary target for Android development. What makes Android so great is that it's extensible and easily modifiable. But don't think that Android will somehow become better if Google make all of these features native. The whole point is that Google doesn't have to dictate your experience on Android, you can make your own.\n\nThe biggest problem with Android that Google have been fixing and will continue to fix is actually the opposite of this. For the majority of users, Android has so many features that are not obvious or are not adequately explained or utilised, that they miss out on the best parts. Sure, Google should continue to innovate and polish. But at the same time, they need to market the best features of Android more, reign in OEM skins, reduce inconsistent UI behavior etc."}

Let me preface this by saying I'm only doing this because you asked. The answer to your question is that no, there isn't any way to get good, cheap craft beer in Australia (that I'm aware of). The reason you haven't found some excellent, cheap beers is because they actually don't really exist, not because you haven't looked hard enough. Now obviously 'good' or 'excellent' are subjective, but I'm not even sure there will be many beers in this price range that even quality as craft which I'm going to take to mean 'not owned by a giant brewing conglomerate. Your options are literally 'drink very boring, bland, tasteless beer' or 'learn to spend more on good beer'.\n\nThat being said, how about $60? I sorted Dan Murphy's catalog by price, started at $60 and picked things where $60 would get you 24:\n\n* A few Mildura Brewery things.

This. This is as good as it gets. $45 for a slab of this is THE BEST bargain you will find in all of beer in Australia.

Coopers and Hoegaarden aren't really craft any more, but Hoegaarden is excellent and Coopers do alright.\n\nThat's it. Below $40 there is nothing.

I'm talking about not knowing their times tables and having to spend 20 seconds figuring out 5x6.\n\n* Poor knowledge of fractions. Adding, multiplying, dividing, taking reciprocals.\n\n* Poor basic algebra skills. Particularly I find that a lot of students don't have a good grasp of distributivity. \n\nAll of this combined leads to students who have great trouble with mathematics, even if they understand the advanced concepts they are being taught. It leads to students who are reluctant to just have a try at solving a problem, even if they have no idea if it's the right approach.\n\nI wouldn't change the curriculum. I think that although it's not perfect, the more pressing issue is allowing for gaps in knowledge to be filled before they become too much of a problem. Teachers should be trained more thoroughly in this. It's a travesty that teachers who spend five hours a week with these students, look at their homework and mark their tests can't pick up that a student has a gap, where as it's obvious to me (somebody with no qualifications other than nearing the end of an undergraduate maths course) within the first one hour session."}

I have this sneaking suspicion that I wont be able to use it much for the next 12 months, and then the iPhone 5 will come out and everything will support NFC. But I sincerely hope that the Galaxy Nexus goes sales crazy, and then everybody starts to develop NFC apps here and now, instead of in a years time. But even if that happens, I'm still really looking forward to the sheer cool factor of pay for stuff ***with my phone***.\n\nLastly, the software. It's the first device with ICS, and will receive updates before anything else. At the end of the day, the hardware is only there to run the software. Software is what smartphones are about, so being able to get updates as soon as possible means that I stay on the bleeding edge just a little longer. And that feels good.

{"created_utc":"1389958200","score":"-4","subreddit":"beer","body":"There's lots I disagree with here.\n\nYou try to invalidate the term hipster by asserting that it's impossible to pick out a group of people who are hipsters. This is true of many societal and cultural labels we place on groups of people. Rules for who belongs to a particular societal or cultural group are inherently fuzzy because they are composed of a different human beings who are all individual.\n\nThat being said, I think I could come up with a perhaps incomplete description of a hipster fairly easily. A hipster is one who:\n\n* Has moved out of home, and is in their 20s or 30s\n* Has a fair to large amount of disposable income\n* Is somewhat materialistic, and enjoys following current trends in fashion, food and culture\n\nNow clearly this isn't going to encompass everybody who some people might call hipsters, but it's a start. Like I said, you can't encompass everybody who is part of a social or cultural group because of the granularity of humans.\n\nIn addition to this, I think hipster is a valid group because it's possible to come to a consensus about who is a hipster or not. You don't necessarily need a set of rules that says 'this person is a hipster if they satisfy conditions x, y and z', but if a group of people can sort other people into the categories 'hipster' and 'non-hipster' with a fair degree of agreement, then clearly there is some set of rules that determines who is a hipster and who isn't, even if they're not explicitly known.\n\nLastly, you're probably correct about all of the psychological issues that are associated with the term hipster. There's definitely an element of perjury to the term, and there's probably a touch of insecurity or envy associated with it as well. But this doesn't mean that the concept of a hipster doesn't exist. It merely means that perhaps the label has grown to encompass not only a group of people, but also some emotional responses as well. In other words, it's basically become the definition of a stereotype. But the mere fact that it's a stereotype doesn't mean that it's automatically a fictional stereotype, for the reasons in the previous few paragraphs."}

Firstly, the 2 door per carriage Siemens trains are sub-optimal for rapid boarding. The author suggests using these on the less busy lines Sandringham and Burnley group lines, instead of the more busy Caulfield group lines like they currently are.\n\nSecondly, the seat layout on the Siemens and X-trapolis trains is conducive to crowding near the doorways. He suggests modifying the seat layout to be more like old Hitachis, which would aid in boarding and alighting while actually providing more seats.\n\nLastly, he suggests standard things that any well run train system should have like station attendants to get the ramp out for disabled passengers instead of the driver, and also to discourage people from trying to hold the doors open to make a train.\n\nAlso, rail patronage today isn't *that* much more than it was in the 1920s. It was around 160 million trips per year in 1924 (according to the paper) and figures from 2011 but the current patronage at about 225 million. However as Dr Mees notes in his paper, they changed the way they count trips. In 1920 if you changed trains once during your trip, that was still one trip. Now, it counts as two trips. So yes, rail patronage has grown, but probably by about 25% since then, not the almost 40% Metro would have you believe."}

{"created_utc":"1363603336","score":"8","subreddit":"melbourne","body":"The reason you got downvotes is because Myki has a few more problems than it should.\n\nElectronic ticketing is something that has been worked out many times before, in many different ways, all of which work well. Just recently I took a trip through Europe and got to see some of the best ticketing systems in the world. The ones that stood out to me were Marseille and London.\n\nOne problem our system has is it sucks for tourists. You have to buy a myki for $7 and you can't get a refund. London has solved this by allowing you to get a refund for the price you pay for an Oyster card. Marseille solved this by having two types of tickets. One is a smartcard which presumably you have to pay for (we didn't check). The other is something that looks like a paper ticket, but is really a piece of cardboard embedded with the same technology in the smartcards. This means that you can have single use tickets without needing two ticketing systems. On top of that, they even recycle the paper cards for reuse. We were going to do this with our system but that scumbag Bailleiu decided it wasn't a good idea.\n\nSecondly, the response time when touching on or off is slow. Granted, our public transport system isn't as busy as London's but it still gets busy in peak times.\n\nOn one of our last days in London, we made the unfortunate decision to take a quick trip back to King's Cross from Oxford Circus. As we got to the underpass we saw a gigantic mass of people moving down the stairs. We assumed this was due to slowness at the ticket gates, but it turned out that the problem was simply caused by too narrow a staircase. As soon as we were out of the staircase the people moved incredibly quickly through the gates.\n\nSo my girlfriend goes through ahead of me, and then I go through. I get through and then I panic, because I thought I'd slipped through the gate behind her without touching on. Nope. Turns out the gates operate so efficiently and quickly that the time between touch ons is so small, it's not worth it for the gates to close in between.\n\nThese are the two main shortcomings of the system in my opinion (particularly the second one). But there are other things that compound my frustration.\n\nFirstly, the system was waaaaaaaay more expensive to develop than it needed to be, and we got a shit product. Somewhere else in this thread it was mentioned that NASA sent Curiosity to Mars for less. This isn't entirely true. But for perspective, myki cost $1.5 billion and apparently Curiosity cost $2.5 billion.\n\nBut the absolute worst part is that from what I've read, the reason we got such a shitty system is to do with greed. Pure and simple. I've never quite understood the specifics, but based on something I think I read on reddit, the reason the government decided to create their own system instead of use an off the shelf solution (of which many superior examples exist) is because if myki is ever used as a microtransaction system (like the Octopus card is in Hong Kong. You can make small purchases at 7-11 with it) then by using their own system, the government get's a cut of the revenue instead of the off the shelf provider.\n\nSorry it was so long, but that's why our system sucks so hard.\n\ntl;dr System has easy to fix problems that have been fixed elsewhere. Our system was expensive (myki $1.5 billion, Curiosity rover $2.5 billion). We ended up with a shitty system due to the government wanting a cut of a potential microstransaction ecosystem."}

I wouldn't again. It's written to be deliberately confusing and is pretty dry anyway). Anyhow, basically the conditions for validity are that the myki has been touched on. There's a bunch of stuff about touching off that is confusing and I don't fully understand, but it's perfectly clear that touching on is necessary for the travel to be valid, and I'm sure that the consequences for non-validity are the fines we all know and love.\n\nSo tl;dr touch on your myki always, even if you have a pass.\n\n"}

They're just inept, plain and simple.\n\nAs for Google not responding, that's not how it works. I'm sure Google could help if they were asked to, but the procedure for getting your public transport data on Google maps is clearly outlined and simple. You put your timetable data in the GTFS format and put it somewhere that Google can pull it from periodically. Then you tell Google what you've done and they set enable it for your city on Google maps.\n\nGiven that PTV already have timetables on their site, the fact that they haven't even done this is FUCKING RIDICULOUS. If they're using some sort of internal piece of software to public the timetables to their website it would be as easy as exporting the timetable in a different format. If they want minimal effort, they could even write a script that would parse the existing web based timetables and spit out a GTFS compliant timetable. This would probably be perhaps a day's work plus a few days of debugging for a decent programmer. Unfortunately, Google will only accept official data from transit authorities, so it's not like somebody can just scrape the PTV site and spit out GTFS files and give them to Google.\n\nThe *slightly* more difficult part of the problem is getting real time updates and locations of vehicles. [OH LOOK, GOOGLE HAS ALREADY FIGURED THIS THE FUCK OUT](http://www.google.com/help/maps/mapcontent/transit/live-updates.html).

My only experience in programming is one first year uni subject, but I bet I could figure this stuff out in a week, tops.\n\nSorry for the rant. tl;dr there is no excuse for PTV not having their data on Google Maps.

Compare this to company like Samsung or Motorolla and the task becomes much more difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, would it be fair to say that Android is developing at a much faster rate than iOS? That'll probably start a flame war, but I'm curious as to people's impressions.\n\nI think that as long as 2 years remains the standard contract length, phone manufacturers should commit to keeping phones updated for 2 years.\n\nAn interesting question is: Why have Apple been able to keep later iterations of iOS running on older hardware? Is it to do with Apple's slower device release cycle? They typically only update their line once a year, where as Android phones are released throughout the year. Is it because new versions of Android are released every 6 months or less, where as iOS only does an update every year when the new iDevice debuts?\n\nEDIT: I also forgot to mention that you can't discount the manufacturer factor, in that every new release of Android has to be made compatible with whatever crap the manufacturer wants to load onto their devices (Touchwiz, Motoblu, Sense etc.).

Extraction was much better when agitating with pellets, but if you're using whole cones then it doesn't matter so much.\n\nThe conclusions say that further research is needed to determine why the concentrations of hop oils actually *fall* after about 24 hours, but it's definitely happening as all of their results lead to that conclusion."}

However, if you're willing to do some math then you should be ok.\n\nBasically, what you need to know is the size of the object and the angle of view of the lens. To get the angle of view you need the sensor size and the focal length of the lens.\n\nTaking the angle of view alpha in degrees, focal length, f in mm and sensor size s in mm, we have the following relationship.\n\nalpha = 2 arctan(s/2f)\n\nSo for a full frame sensor (35mm) and a 30mm lens we have alpha = 60.5 degrees.\n\nAll that's left to do is some basic trigonometry. Constructing a triangle composed of basically half the angle of view in whichever direction gives the maximal coverage of the subject, we have the following formula with x being the distance to subject, w being the width of the subject and alpha again being the field of view:\n\nx = (w/2) / tan(alpha/2)\n\nSo for example, if you had a teddy bear that was 20cm wide and 40cm tall, we pick the largest dimension (40cm = .4m). Plugging this into our equation along with the 60.5 degrees we got before we get x = 0.34m or 34 cm.\n\nThis makes a bit of sense, since it's a wide angle lens, so you'd expect something as small as a teddy bear would need to be pretty close to fill the field of view."}

{"created_utc":"1364991786","score":"5","subreddit":"photography","body":"Yes, and yes.\n\nWhen Lightroom 'supports' your body, it means that it will read the RAW files that it produces. For example, I had LR 4.3, but it refused to read the RAW files that my D7100 produced. Now that LR 4.4 is out, it will (yay!). Now, I tricked Lightroom into opening my RAW files by changing the EXIF data to look like the shots were from a D5200, but this only worked because the sensors are almost identical (except the D7100 doesn't have an AA filter). As far as I'm aware, the reason Lightroom needs to 'support' your camera at all isn't because it can't interpret the RAW data, but because of the particular quirks of the Bayer filter that allows us to take color photos. The Bayer filter for each sensor can have its pixels arranged in different ways and this needs to be accounted for when importing a RAW file.\n\nIf you shot JPEGs then Lightroom would definitely read them.\n\nAs for the lenses, Lightroom lets you automatically correct for distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberration. So when your lens is supported, I guess it means that the scientists at Adobe's Labs have taken detailed measurements with that lens and programmed Lightroom in a way that it will correct for all of these flaws."}

Another version of this song you might like to listen to is the [Royal Crown Revue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftCXIAfFs6E) version, mainly because I love Eddie Nichols' voice and you remind me a little of him in the quality of your low notes.\n\nThe thing that's immediately noticeable is that you have problems with attack. Your tone is lovely once you hone in on the right pitch, but your attacks aren't as confident sometimes. You also have a tendency to be slightly flat on your attack and then correct it towards the middle of the note. Don't do that.\n\nBasically, be more confident, and try to imagine the pitch in your head before you sing it. It's not good to have beautiful middles and ends to notes if the beginning isn't just as good.\n\nAlso, your lower register is really resonant but your high notes sound a bit thin. You've got two choices here. Either take the song down a few tones and sing it there or work on your upper register. One of those is definitely easier than the other.\n\nSomething that really helped with me hitting high notes (I'm a classically trained Tenor) is if you're standing, when you're about to hit that big note, relax your body and go into a half squat just before you sing the important high note in the phrase. Not too much, but basically just bend them more than usual.\n\nFor me it helped to loosen up my body and help me worry less about hitting the note. My biggest problem with nailing high notes is not so much that I don't have the range, but that I'm worried they're going to sound bad. If you're worried about it sounding bad then it probably will sound bad.\n\nObviously you can't start doing a squat during a performance, but once you've done the squat a few times then try and internalise it and recall those same feelings when you're performing."}

We can look overseas, but even then it usually comes down to a situation (especially in healthcare and education) where the optimal solution (as judged by international metrics) would require either too much money (shit excuse, but politicians are sadly extremely adverse to thinking further than an election term ahead) or would require gigantic cultural shifts to achieve.

When I'm playing, my thumb doesn't cover the ship at all, which is just the way it should be.\n\n* I agree that you've made the in app purchasing unobtrusive.\n\n* You've put 3D in, but you haven't really used it much (unless I'm missing something). It would be great to be able to see your ship while you're upgrading it, so that you can see the extra cannons and missle launchers and what-not bolted on to it as you buy the upgrades. Also, custom colors would be cool.\n\n* You either need to have more instructions on first play, or more popups/tooltip sort of things. The things that stuck out to me were: Explaining that shooting is handled for you, and a popup when you don't have enough money to buy things.\n\n* Is there a way to go back and play previous levels?\n\n* If you're going to make a show of having the credits you collected in a given sector count up, then you shouldn't have the total after you've added your credits there on the left already. It give you a false sense of hope, like \"Oh, I have so many credits now that I've gained an extra 200. Oh wait, no I don't.\" Basically, that's a bad way of saying that I (and others, I'm sure) expect that the credits will count up to however many you collected, and then get added to your total. Not the other way around.\n\n* Difficulty seems about right, although I'm not terribly far in.\n\n* I was confused at first as to why I was losing all of my weapons upgrades when I crashed. Either mention that this happens, or maybe make it more obvious that your ship is starting anew, perhaps with more of an explosion or more blinking or something.\n\nSorry if it sounds like I'm criticising a lot.

Surely you don't think it's a better idea to get the general public's opinion on something?\n\n&gt; They are not paying for it. \n\nIf they pay taxes, then yes they are.\n\n&gt; How much bandwidth will the average home user really need.\n\nAnd we've reached the core misconception. To claim that the average household's bandwidth usage will somehow stagnate at current levels, or that it will stagnate in the future would completely countermand every single trend in the technology industry since the beginning. The one immutable fact is that there is always a thirst for faster, larger, better and more powerful, and that if you build it, people will use it. Not only will they use it, but they'll monetize it.\n\n&gt; An extra 30 billion spent would rebuild every major hospital in australia, is it worth it? I dont know but the level of fear mongering about AUS wasting its money as its not cutting edge is disgusting as its just a small minority playing to its wants.\n\nFirstly, I'd refute that it's a minority playing to its wants. Polls have shown that although the LNP won the election, the majority of Australians would prefer FTTP over FTTN.\n\nSecondly, you said that you don't know whether FTTP is worth it. This again ties into the idea that it's difficult to predict the future of technology. It will be worth it with 100% certainty, but *the ways* in which our current investment will pay off in the future are completely unknown because it's highly likely that the technologies and services that will infuse immense amounts of money into our economy and improve our quality of life most likely haven't been invented yet.\n\nThis is what makes convincing people that installing FTTP is worth it so damn difficult. If there were technologies that required the sorts of bandwidth that FTTP will provide easily and FTTN wont, it would be trivial for Labor to say \"here's all the stuff you'll be missing out on if we install FTTN\" and it would be the end of the story. Unfortunately, they don't exist yet. But they will. I can say that with 100% certainty."}

However, you assume a few things.\n\nFirstly, you assume that a large number of businesses will ban Glass. A few businesses *might* ban Glass in the beginning, but they will be in the overwhelming minority. Recording somebody with Glass is no more discrete than using your phone to record somebody. The idea that Glass somehow invades privacy any more than a smartphone is absurd.\n\nSecondly, you're basically assuming that Glass is going to be crap. This isn't really something that we can have an educated argument about, because Glass isn't in enough hands and hasn't been developed for enough for anybody to determine whether it's going to be a success or failure. Having a persistent, connected device with a display partially in your vision is **completely** different from any other piece of technology that anybody has ever used. We can't just cut and paste UI or UX paradigms from smartphones or PCs onto it and expect them to work. The fact is, almost nobody knows how this space is going to develop, just like nobody could have predicted the ways that smartphones have developed.\n\nBut if it is extremely useful (as I strongly feel it will be) and it does become indispensable (like Robert Scoble is finding it) then having to take it off to drive or having to either take it off in a very small number of businesses or find an alternate business that allows Glass is going to be easily worth the benefit to the rest of your life.\n"}

Put a few drops on the plate and then turn the calibration screw until it reads exactly zero.\n\nThere's also another calibration step that you can do. Basically, you take a hydrometer reading *and* a refractometer reading of the same sample. This gives you a factor that you can put into beersmith and it will use this to calculate SG from brix. Repeat this 30 times and you should have a really accurate conversion factor. Personally I haven't bothered with this, as I've heard the correction factor can vary with wort color. If I have to take a hydrometer reading every time then it defeats the purpose of having a refractometer. However I'm willing to be convinced that I should do this.\n\nIf you're taking a pre-boil gravity reading, just put a few drops onto the plate and read off the value in brix. Then plug those into beersmith to get an SG.\n\nIf you're taking post-boil gravity, then make sure your sample is cool before taking a reading. My refractometer has automatic temperature compensation between 0 and 30C, but yours might not. Make sure the sample is at the correct temperature for your refractometer. Again here, put a few drops onto the plate and read off the value, then convert it using beersmith.\n\nFor samples that are either partially or entirely fermented, the alcohol in the sample alters the index of refraction of the liquid. But if you know the starting gravity (which you should) then you can correct for this. Thankfully, beersmith can do the corrections for you. So take your sample, put it on the plate, take the reading in brix, and then put both the reading and your SG into beersmith, making sure to select 'fermenting wort gravity' from the drop-down list. You've now got a final gravity."}

What they were doing was a gigantic change to the way Android works, and was more akin to a fork than a customization. It could cause significant headaches for everybody at the Android team as well as developers, because they would have to constantly be accounting for the possibility that they were running in multi window mode.\n\nShe didn't explicitly shutdown the project, but she was strongly against it. It's the sort of feature where a bunch of devs might be able to make it work under certain circumstances most of the time, but it really needs Google's oversight and blessing in order to work properly and across all apps and devices.\n\nI've never used the multiwindow feature on Samsung devices, but does it work with all apps or only some of them? Regardless, I suspect the reason Google haven't cracked the whip on Samsung is more because Samsung came up with a good way to implement it that didn't break everybody's apps, rather than just a power or market share argument. Google has more power over Samsung than you think.\n\nEDIT: /u/Phrodo_00 answered me below. The apps that want to run in multi window mode need a certain library. So that's why Google hasn't 'shut down Samsung's multiwindow' so to speak. Cornerstone was trying to shoehorn every single app into this multi window mode without the apps knowledge and that's what had Dianne Hackborn worried. Completely different.

You then leave it for a week or so for primary, bottle immediately and then you have to wait three months for the lacto to do its thing. Because the lactobacillus has much more time to sour and create interesting compounds, the flavor profile will be different.\n\nI've done a sour mash Berliner Weisse, and I was very happy with the results. That being said, I'm fairly sure it got reinfected with lacto sometime during the third week of primary, which I did not intend.

If you remove those descriptors, then the reviews are basically the same.\n\nMy point is, using specific flavor descriptors is mostly about recall. You need to have a clear idea of what different fruits smell and taste like, and then you need to be able to recall that when prompted. Otherwise you end up with the first review which is general and non-specific.\n\nThe other issue at play is flavor descriptors can mean different things to different people, or different people might call the same thing different names. Biscuit is a good example. To me, biscuit is a sort of sweet, slightly nutty flavor that I usually get on the late palate. But right there in describing it, I've used perfectly valid descriptors that might be used by somebody else to describe the same flavor. And therein lies the problem. We're tasting the same things, but the best way that we can communicate what we taste is language, which is fundamentally an imperfect medium.\n\nSo if you can't taste specific flavors, it doesn't really matter. If you want to be able to give names to things, have a go at training your palate. Pick a bunch of flavor descriptors you commonly see but can't identify in beers, and buy the raw ingredient. Buy some pineapple, some mango, some guava, some grapefruit etc. if you're really into hoppy beers. Sit down with those ingredients, taste them, smell them, get to know them. Maybe even sit down with a beer next to it and see if you can pick up flavors when you're smelling and tasting side by side.

They're not in the top 10 cows milk producers (not surprising), but they are in fact the 4th largest global producer of sheep's milk (at about 700,000 metric tonnes per year in 2012) and the 8th largest producer of goat's milk (at about 400,000 metric tonnes per year in 2012). However this is about a half and a tenth of the top producers of sheep and goat milk respectively, so they're not doing great.\n\nThe issue is that you need to make a quality play here. I'm a Greek. I'll buy Greek EVOO over other olive oil (well, my family owns olive groves so we get some sent over in exchange for family members cultivating them and taking the rest of the profits), and I'll buy Greek feta over Danish or Australian feta because the taste is different and I like it better.

At the perception end, it's not a lock and key mechanism like you might have been taught in school. Multiple keys fit in multiple locks, ie. multiple chemical compounds can trigger multiple different receptors. On the processing side, it's tied into your genetics, preferences, past experiences, ability to recall flavors, vocabulary and probably a bunch of other things.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, is that the things you actually taste could be quite different to somebody else, in the sense that the neurons that get activated between your sensory receptors and your brain are different. But at the same time, the way those are processed could be quite different. To expect multiple people to come up with the same descriptors for the same beers is ludicrous.\n\nThat being said, I think it's undeniable that particular flavors are present in particular beers. My family who are not beer drinkers can usually pick hoppy IPAs that use tropical fruity hops. You give somebody a beer with chocolate or coffee notes for the first time, and they'll tell you. That alone is enough to convince me. The fact that I've been on beer review websites numerous times and found that I've tasted or smelled the same things only further supports that point in my mind. But before I had experienced it, I was definitely extremely skeptical. And the only way I started to recognise those flavors was when I started making an active effort to document them.\n\nTo actually address your post:\n\n&gt; I have the wrong definition of these words or people just talk out of their asses.\n\nThe former is very possible, but there's nothing wrong about your definition. Simply different. It should be expected that people might call the same flavor different things.\n\n&gt; I'm not getting \"malted notes of caramel and toffee\" with this beer. To me it just seems like wheaty IPA with a tiny bit of maltiness.\n\nRight. Looking back on my review of A Little Sumpin' Sumpin', I said I tasted some graininess (which is probably what you describe as 'wheaty') and I've got lots of hop descriptors (I said grapefruit, orange, lemon peel, pine, but admittedly I tend to always taste those flavors on non-tropical hops)\n\nSo basically, I agree with you, but I was just a little more specific in what I felt I tasted.\n\n&gt; Do people say caramel because the bit of maltiness combined with the fact that it's sweet?\n\nYes, pretty much.\n\nApologies for the wall of text."}

The solutions are to just let the subreddit die, or to splinter off into new subreddits.\n\nA good example of this is /r/tf2 and /r/truetf2. /r/tf2 is mostly memes, videos and other crap. /r/truetf2 is where the deep discussion of tactics and gameplay happens.

The second method is very finicky but creates perfect results.\n\nFirst, the wrap:\n\nTake a small bowl, and place some cling film in it. Crack an egg into the bowl, then wrap up the cling film with the egg inside and either twist or tie a knot or both to stop the end opening. Drop this in to boiling water for the desired amount of time. Remove and allow to cool a little before slicing open the cling film and serving.\n\nThe other way is from Heston Blumenthal's latest series, How to cook like Heston. If you can find it, it's the episode on eggs and it explains it perfectly. There's also an official recipe [here]( http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/chefs/heston-blumenthal/poached-eggs-recipe), but I'll write it out with my own annotations.\n\nAdd water and a pinch of salt to a saucepan. Place a small plate in the bottom, with the underside facing upwards. This is to protect the egg from excessive heat. Bring the water to 80\u00b0C.\n\nNext, crack the egg onto a slotted spoon and allow it to drain for a minute. As eggs age, their whites turn runny. Runnier than normal. This is what causes the spindley bits that ruin your poached egg. It may seem like a waste of egg, but it produces the best results and it can easily be counteracted by using fresh eggs.\n\nNow, put the egg into the water gently and carefully slide it off of the spoon and into the upturned plate. Cooking time is 4 minutes. If your water is actually at 80\u00b0C then this will result in a perfectly poached egg with a nice runny centre. Hence, use a thermometer.\n\nThat's it. It may sound like a bunch of wank and unnecessary crap, but it works perfectly. What you have to understand if you're a Heston hater is that at least with respect to his techniques, he's arrived at them via the scientific method. He conducts months of trials to figure out the best way to cook things. You may not trust his palate and his crazy flavor combinations, but his cooking methods work and are incredible when done properly. If anyone's interested I also cooked one of his chicken recipes. Overnight brining and 8 hour cooking."}

Throwing out a fairly tame seasonal every once in a while, while keeping a fairly boring core range is not advancing craft beer in this country. I'm not asking them to start making crazy beers on the level of somebody like Moon Dog. But there are a few things they could do.\n\n* Add a few more beers to their core range. Maybe a saison because I think they're great for our climate, maybe an amber or a stout because they should be part of any good lineup.\n\n* Start some yearly releases. Maybe a once a year barleywine or oaked/otherwise special stout.\n\n* Make the seasonals more interesting\n\nAll of these should be well within the realms of possibility especially since they've got that Lion money.

The graphics are somewhat pixelated in places on my Nexus 7, and there are some strange glitches where menus will layer over other menus and such. The UI is really information dense, but I think it could be more beautiful and more informative, and I think there's a better way to point you to what you need to press than a giant arrow.\n\nOverall, this game has LOADS of potential, and is already quite good, but it needs some polish."}

Specifically, what Android is, what phones run Android, and what users can get out of Android. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that money talks. Consumers buy Samsung and HTC's phones even though the skinned experience is inferior to the stock experience in almost every way (faster updates, universal look and feel) so the OEMs have no incentive to produce un skinned phones. But if Google can educate users, then perhaps they'll start to demand stock phones. \n\nLet me just throw out an idea. First off, sometime between Android versions, Google runs a campaign that explains what Android is to the average consumer. Maybe a montage of people using different phones, and then something about how they're all powered by Android. Similar to how Intel markets themselves. \n\nThen, as soon as the next version of Android hits (ie. Launch day for the new Nexus) they run another campaign that shows off the new features of the latest version. Suddenly, mom and pop Android user are thinking \"you just told me that I had android, why don't I have those features?\". Then it gets some national coverage (just like Apple's great new maps), and suddenly my Grandma is asking me about the new Google Now feature and why her new phone doesn't have it (she did discuss with me the Apple Maps).

During winter it's not so bad unless your house gets really cold.\n\nI know you literally just started this sub because /r/Homebrewing wasn't working for you, but it really is a great resource. Beer is made in basically the same way everywhere in the world. Read stuff there for basic tips like how to get into partial mash or all grain, how to come up with a recipe etc. We actually have a bit of an advantage being in Australia, because lots of interesting hops like Galaxy and Nelson Sauvin are from Australia and NZ respectively, and so they're easy for us to find but hard for people elsewhere to get a hold of.\n\nMake sure you're properly treating your water. If you're doing kits then you don't need to adjust for minerals, but you should probably invest in some Campden tablets. Even though we have fairly low levels of chlorine (at least in Melbourne), it's still noticeable when somebody hasn't used a campden tablet to get rid of the chlorine. This is part of what contributes to that 'homebrew' flavour. You might not think it makes much of a difference, but for me it was like night and day after tasting my Dad and uncle's homebrew for years without Campden, and then tasting my own with Campden.\n\nLastly, if you want to brew interesting beer that will make your friends and family actually want to drink your beer, you need inspiration. If you're just looking at it as a way to save money and brew plain lagers, then there's nothing wrong with that. But homebrewing gets really interesting when you start experimenting with new styles and interesting combinations of ingredients and flavours. And in order to figure out what you want to drink and what will taste good together, you need to taste lots of commercial beer. There's no way around it. Go and search in /r/ausbeer or ask for some bars or bottleshops in your city that serve craft beer and go and try some (if you already haven't).\n\nThe reason I enjoy beer over wine is because you don't need to spend a fortune to enjoy some of the best beers in the world (though it might seem like a fortune if you're not used to the prices), and to taste some really diverse flavours. Yes they're expensive. But you're not paying $50 a bottle before you start getting into the really good stuff. My justification for craft beer being so much more expensive than regular beer is this: you wouldn't expect to get an amazing wine for $3 a bottle, so why do you expect any less of beer? It costs basically as little as possible under the current taxation system and with enough margin for the industry to continue growing.\n\nGot a bit ranty, but I hope some of that helps.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and make sure you take notes on everything, including gravities, times, measurements etc. Also try and be as exact as you can with measurements and times. If you can't follow a recipe, you probably won't make very good beer. And if you don't take notes, when you do by chance make a good beer you'll have no way of recreating it."}

{"created_utc":"1380958734","score":"9","subreddit":"Homebrewing","body":"On the most basic of levels, you're mixing hot water with milled grains and letting it sit for an hour, before draining off the liquid and washing the grains to get all of the sugars.\n\nThe temperature you mash at determines the fermentability of the wort. Basically, if you mash at a lower temperature you get a more fermentable wort which gives a lower FG and hence a drier beer, and if you mash at a higher temperature you get a less fermentable wort, which means a higher FG and a sweeter beer. You usually want to heat your mash water (called the strike water) to slightly higher than you intend to mash at because you will lose some heat as a result of having to heat up the mash tun and the grains.\n\nFermentability also affects the body of the beer, so generally a lower mash temp gives a lighter bodied beer and a higher mash temp gives a heavier body.\n\nWhat's happening during the mash is that enzymes present in the grains are breaking down the starches in the grains into sugars. Different enzymes have different optimal temperatures, hence the different mash temperatures producing different worts.\n\nIn order to get the maximum amount of sugar possible out of the mashed grains, you need to rinse them. This is called the sparge. You can batch sparge where you just dump water onto them and give it a stir or you can fly sparge where you add and remove water at the same rate, so the level of the water in your mash tun remains the same. Fly sparging gets more sugar out of the grains but batch sparging is much easier."}

Their latest phones are acceptable, but there are much better options out there for the same price.\n\nUnfortunately though, they're probably here to stay. Chinese OEMs are doing great stuff but their hardware isn't getting picked up by carriers. LG is falling over itself to copy everything that Samsung does, and it isn't really doing a good enough job. Sony and HTC are producing really great hardware but their marketing is shit.\n\nSo here's my theory as to one way Samsung could be dethroned. If Samsung forks Android then they're dead. 100% completely fucked. Microsoft and Blackberry have learnt that trying to get developers on board with a new platform is really really difficult, and I'm not sure that even with their considerable amount of money they could put together enough incentives to get Android developers to develop for their new platform.\n\nI'd like to think Motorola could stand a chance. Google finally have some hardware to innovate with, and they do some really tight integration with new Android features.

I'm getting a Nexus 5 when it comes out. It will cost me probably $400 or $450 since these are likely to be the prices in Australia. My phone provider is an MVNO with pretty decent coverage. I get unlimited talk and text and 4GB of data for $40 a month, which is an incredible deal in Australia.\n\nIf you go on contract in Australia, the way it usually works with current flagship devices is that you pay $10 or so upfront for the handset, and then you have a handset fee of $5 or so per month. Now this sounds great, but then you have to consider that a plan that costs $65 per month gets you unlimited calls and texts, but only 1.5GB of data.\n\nIf you add that all up, going off contract comes to around $1400 over the course of the 24 month contract, while going on contract comes to $1550. Not a gigantic difference, but it's a difference, especially considering the contract price only gets me 1.5GB of data per month.\n\nWhen you consider the other advantages of being off contract though, the difference is more significant.\n\nFirstly, I own my handset. So if I feel like upgrading in a years time, I can just sell it, getting me some money back.\n\nSecondly, I am able to easily change providers. Just say another carrier comes out with the same plan for $30 per month. Or they have better coverage. Or I decided to move overseas. I can just switch. I'm not in a contract, and that gives me extra flexibility.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, by getting your device straight from Google you're guaranteed updates on time. Not only is this not true of on contract devices, it's not even necessarily true of on contract Nexus devices.\n\nSo for those reasons, it makes much more sense to me to buy off contract. The monetary saving isn't gigantic, but it's a saving, and the extra flexibility and quick updates are worth it to me."}

{"created_utc":"1323225215","score":"25","subreddit":"Android","body":"Please don't listen to this guy.\n\nI have a Galaxy Nexus and the images it takes are great.\n\nLet me address the OP's point one by one.\n\n&gt; Shutter speed: Yeah it's cool that it can take photos fast, but photos end up really really blurry, I have to take 4-5 photos and HOPE that at least one of them turns out to be okay. I try to HOLD the 'take photo\" button (blue dot) and it seems like it helps a little bit.\n\nThe Galaxy Nexus doesn't necessarily have a faster shutter speed than other cameras. Shutter speed is basically how long the shutter is open for, so that the camera sensor can collect light (I'm not an expert here, but this is the general idea. It may be different for digital or mobile phone cameras in terms of the actual mechanics, but the principle is the same). Shutter speed is what affects blurryness. If the shutter is open too long, yes you get more light (ie. a brighter photo), but there's also more opportunity for the subject to move, giving you a blurry photo. In regards to shutter speed, the Galaxy Nexus is probably completely typical.\n\nThe feature that you're referring to is Zero shutter **lag**. Shutter lag is the time between when you press the shutter button and when the shutter actually releases (or something like that :p. Again, I'm not an expert, but this is the gist). The way this manifests itself is in almost instant photo taking, and no downtime between photos.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the shutter speed of the Galaxy Nexus is no different to that of other phones, and the shutter lag doesn't affect blurryness at all. So if you're taking blurry photos, it's because you're moving. It has nothing to do with the Galaxy Nexus.\n\n&gt; Digital Zoom: The zoom works well, but when I try to take a picture everything ends up being out of focus!\n\nDigital Zoom is always terrible, everywhere, all of the time. Get used to it.\n\n&gt; Photos are really dark in the gallery: For some reason the colours don't match up from what I see in the view finder and the gallery. When I view the photo in the gallery it looks 3-4 times darker.\n\nThis is probably a flash issue. If you take a photo with flash on, obviously the photo is going to be brighter than what it seemed on the screen a second before the flash went off. This is the point of flash. Try turning it off.\n\n&gt; BONUS: The camera app icon totally looks out of place and nothing like other icons, but that's a story for another day.\n\nThat's a matter of opinion I suppose.\n\nIn summary, I love this camera. It takes great, sharp, detailed photos.\n"}

In my opinion, there is no other viable platform, and forking would be basically suicide since it would mean an extremely large amount of work for developers with little to no gain.\n\n&gt;So basically, I'm seeing what Microsoft are most likely going to do with Nokia and looking at Google and Motorola and thinking \"if Microsoft can, why not Google\". I'm aware that Nokia is basically the only company who have put any effort into Windows Phone, where as Android is a very diverse ecosystem with lots of players. However as I said in the last paragraph, there's not really much the OEMs can do about it if Google gives Motorola some preferential treatment. Regardless, I'm not entirely sure if giving Motorola preferential treatment would actually take sales away from Samsung et al.

Are they pleasing or bad? \n\nNext, taste. What can you taste? When does each taste happen: when you first put it in your mouth, in the middle of the mouthful or on the finish? Are the tastes distinct or muddled? Strong or weak? Complementary or clashing? Pleasing or disgusting? \n\nNext, palate. What does the beer feel like in your mouth? Is it fizzy, soft, fluffy, oily or something else? Is it light on heavy? Does it coat your mouth? Does it linger or go away instantly? Personally, I also include whether or not the flavours are simplistic or complex and nuanced, as well as how many different flavours there are in here, but this might be a little non-standard. \n\nFinally, you have either a hedonistic or a style based assessment. \n\nHedonistic means 'did you like the beer or not?'. Plain and simple. If so, how much? \n\nIf you're rating to style, then you're looking at how well the beer adheres to the key qualities of its style.

{"created_utc":"1397979388","score":"6","subreddit":"malefashionadvice","body":"I think it's possible, but hard. I'm currently trying to.\n\nSome tips:\n\n* Know what you can buy and spend lots of money on that will fit you regardless. This includes shoes, watches, bags and other accessories. These will still fit you if you gain or lose weight, or at least can be made to fit you with very minimal money and effort. They can also help to add a bit of interest to your outfit, because you're probably going to have to stick to basics with everything else.\n\n* Have stuff tailored. Shirts will probably fit you around the shoulders but not around the waist, and pants will have giant cuff openings. Tailoring can fix this for relatively cheap.\n\n* If you're going to lose weight, don't buy super expensive stuff unless you're made of money. As good as tailoring is, it's easier and better to just buy cheap stuff until you're thin and then buy some good fitting expensive things. If you spend less money on stuff then you have more money to get it tailored, because chances are it won't fit well.\n\n* Layers are your friend. I wish I lived in a colder climate, because F/W here in Melbourne, Australia is often not cold enough to go more than 2 layers. But when I wear shirt/tee, sweater and a coat it helps to hide my size a little.\n\n* Don't be too disheartened if you go somewhere and nothing fits. I've done this a couple of times (most recently with Uniqlo) and it's a really shitty feeling. Be realistic, and keep those stores in the back of your mind for when you lose some weight.\n\nGood luck with it. It's frustrating to have to go to so much effort to get good fitting clothes when everybody else can just walk into a store and find stuff that fits them well. It's worth it in the end though, and being proud of your appearance will serve as a little bit of motivation to lose weight."}

It should just smell like clay or dust.\n\n* It should have a dull sheen, but not be too shiny.\n\n* It should be rough to the touch, like sand or sandpaper.\n\n* It should have a 'sonorous ring' when the lid is lightly tapped against the pot. A good example of what a really fine teapot sounds like can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_OoIxP5zYE)\n\n* The fifth section is written in poor english, but I think the gist is that on a fake teapot, the characteristics of the clay will cause the water running down the side to form droplets (presumably because the surface finish of the teapot retards water, causing it to form drops) where on an authentic teapot, the water will simply soak into the teapot and not form drops\n\n* There should be no discoloration of the water when poured into the teapot. Any artificial colors or chemicals in the pot mean that it's not authentic.

You know where the centre is (and it's self centering), you know how far the maximum deflection is, and you can actually feel which direction you're pushing the stick in.

The mouse is fundamentally unconstrained, and personally when I use a mouse I feel like I'm 'getting out of sync' with the actual inputs I'm giving to the aircraft or spacecraft.\n\nThe other reason a HOTAS setup is superior is because if you decide to go the mouse and keyboard route, you don't have easy access to the entire keyboard, since you've got one hand on the mouse.

Basically what this means is they use a device to measure the color that the screen actually puts out when you tell it to display a certain color, and then checks this against a scientifically determined standard. You can then adjust the screen so that it matches this standard as precisely as possible.\n\nSo regardless of whether your device has an AMOLED screen or an LCD screen, if it's not calibrated properly it's not going to show you proper colours. Now most people aren't going to care, but if you calibrate screens you also get the added benefit of less variation between individual handsets of the same model. You also avoid strange color casts that can occur.\n\nIt's possible to calibrate your screen after you've bought the device, but for that you need to be running a custom kernel that supports color control and you need a calibration device which can be hundreds of dollars."}

{"created_utc":"1375006191","score":"5","subreddit":"AndroidGaming","body":"There are two ways to implement this model.\n\nOne is so incredibly frustrating that I will flat out refuse to play a game that implements it, unless it's one of the most amazing games I've ever played in my life. This model is where in order to progress in the the game or to accomplish things in the game, you must pay money. Often, you'll be able to play the game for some period of time or until you exhaust some amount of resource, and then you'll be offered the choice to either buy some more gameplay or wait.\n\nI'm not going to ever play this sort of game. The whole point of a game is that I can play it when I want, and if I want to invest time and effort into it then I should be able to. There's already a game where you have to spend inordinate amounts of time and money to progress. That game is called 'life'.\n\nThe other type of game that has IAPs is one where the IAPs are either purely cosmetic, or are optional upgrades that may make the game more fun or significantly easier. But at no time do you feel like you need these IAPs to progress or to make the game enjoyable. These games are fine.\n\nNow that being said, there are ways of implementing the first model that I'm perfectly happy with. For example, Triple Town. You're offered the option of buying coins in order to buy more moves, but you can also just pay a flat $5ish fee and have unlimited turns for life. This is perfect. It allows me to pay a once off fee and play the game to my hearts content.\n\nI understand that developers need to make money. However by implementing IAPs, you're 100% guaranteed to make less money off of me. I would happily pay $5 or even more for a good to great game, but I'm actually much less likely to make a number of small purchases, even if those purchases add up to $5. It's simply the idea that in order to complete your game I might have to spend a potentially unlimited amount of money. It's just something I can't and wont accept.\n\nA perfect example of a developer making a fuckload of money off of IAPs that don't actually affect gameplay is TF2. You get sucked in by the amazing gameplay, and then you're tempted to spend money in order to enhance your experience in the game. The key thing here is that you're drawn into the game first, and then you're tempted to spend money. People who first start playing TF2 have little interest in cosmetic items, but as they play they begin to want them.\n\nContrast this with the first IAP approach I mentioned, which is essentially 'pay us a little, then play a bit'. You have to pay first, and then you get a little slice of gameplay. But there isn't much incentive for me to pay you if I haven't been hooked by the gameplay in the first place.\n\nSo in summary, there are both good and bad ways of going about this. I sincerely hope one model dies extremely soon."}

I don't think I've ever seen an English language website that accommodated people with a single name. Every signup page I can remember has a space for your first name and a space for your last name. You're inventing an issue that doesn't exist. Even if there are some people who feel really strongly that they want to use a non-anglicised name or have one name, Google specifically allows for this in their [Profile Name Policy](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1228271?hl=en).\n\n&gt; At this time, using just one name isn\u2019t permitted through our current sign-up process. It would be difficult to find people if you had to simply search for \u201cBrian\u201d or \u201cRajiv\u201d. Two part names make the network much easier to use and better for our users. If you actually do have a single-part name, then you should enter it as your first name, and a simple dot (\u201c.\u201d) as your last name, then go through the appeals process..\n\nGoogle aren't idiots. If somebody has an unusual name they're not going to get banned for it provided they can produce adequate evidence that that is actually their name.\n\nYour non-english name reason is crap. Pure crap. Your other reason is valid, but it includes an incredibly small amount of people. In addition, whistleblowers should blow the whistle somewhere other than on Google+. Alternatively, I very much doubt that they would get banned for making an account with a fake name before they got the chance to blow the whistle. Abuse victims should probably find better forums than Google+, but if they insist then there's nothing stopping them from not sharing their posts with the public.\n\nEDIT: Also, have a read of this article: [Falsehoods programmers believe about names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/).

They can't really guarantee any speeds to anybody, because the state of the copper network is so shitty. They're essentially setting themselves up for the situation where they provide a great signal to the node, and then everything after that is crap.\n\nOn the other hand, FTTP is just about guaranteed. You can provide 2.5Gbit/s shared among 32 people using GPON, so that's not 100mbps per person, but it's fairly close. In addition, the situation where everybody on that bit of fibre signs up for 100mbps is fairly unlikely. Finally, the upgrade to XGPON is fairly easy, because you just upgrade the equipment at each end of the fibre. XGPON is capable of delivering 10Gbit/s per fibre cable.\n\nSo the point that's being made, is that we're spending 40 billion on technology that isn't guaranteed to give us anything. 25mbps is possible with VDSL, but it's very dependant on the quality of copper. If your copper is shit, expect much less. 50mbps is a pipe dream, reserved only for people very very close to the node with shiny new copper. And the LNP sure as fuck aren't going to replace all the copper in the network, or at least they haven't costed for it."}

The fact that they owned them before becoming members of the NBN Co board is somewhat irrelevant.

{"created_utc":"1320669010","score":"3","subreddit":"Android","body":"It's such a dilemma. There are so many competing forces. I think that the idea of naming like a car is a sound one. Let me elaborate.\n\nThe manufacturer would have a number of models. Galaxy S, Epic, Gio, Wave, Omnia etc. (using Samsung as an example). Then, you append to that a number, or a year. Personally I think a year is more useful, but numbers aren't too bad either.\n\nThe idea here is that each model would be based around certain key characteristics. These would be: screen size, QWERTY or no, OS (Android, Windows Phone, whatever), and perhaps even quality of hardware (speed of processor or graphics, although one could argue that you could just stick the cheapest hardware in the smaller screened devices and leave the good hardware for the larger screen). I think this almost emulates what Apple do, in that the device name represents a specific form factor. So everyone might know that Samsung's Galaxy line is the top of the range with no QWERTY and running Android. Samsung Galaxy '11 (or Samsung Galaxy 2 if you prefer) is not as good as the Samsung Galaxy '12, but better than the Samsung Galaxy '10.\n\nI guess the advantage of having numbers instead of years is that you can refresh in less or more than a years time, but honestly, I don't want to be buying phones more than one a year.\n\nAs for the carrier issue, I think there are two solutions that are far and away better than the current situation.\n\nSolution number 1 is that the US carriers stop being douchebags, follow what the rest of the world is doing, and just slap Sim cards in existing phones. This can only be good for the consumer in my opinion, because it encourages competition on fronts such as pricing, coverage, and more recently, speed of data, rather than pissing competitions as to who can have the slightly most super dooperest betterest version of the GS2\n\nThe other solution is to make certain phones carrier exclusive. This is not as good as option 1, but it still allows carriers to compete based on handset.\n\nI didn't mean to make my post this long, but basically, I'm all for this idea. I think it would greatly simplify buying phones for everyone."}

Unfortunately, people are much more inclined to save money in the short term by buying on contract instead of saving money in the long term by buying unlocked and being free to pick the best carrier with the lowest prices. So even though it's cheaper overall to get a Nexus 4, people need another reason to buy it due to habit and human nature.\n\nThe extra things that the Nexus 4 has going for it (for the general populace) are the updated software but primarily the latest hardware. As soon as the Nexus 4 is not latest gen hardware then you instantly lose a large amount of sales because people are already attracted to the cheap upfront cost of a contract, and if the hardware is better too then for most people it's a no-brainer.\n\nWhat Google should be aiming for is creating a strong brand that they can continue to leverage. The Samsung Galaxy brand is extremely recognisable, despite the fact that most people just called the GS3 the 'Samsung Galaxy'. Google need to make Nexus a household name like iPhone and Samsung Galaxy are. That way they can gain momentum each Nexus release and start to see huge sales figures and eventually make everyone see why stock Android matters.\n\ntl;dr The Nexus 4 will only be attractive as long as it's the best hardware out because people are so used to carrier subsidies that they'll stop wanting it as soon as something better comes along. If Google can quickly establish the Nexus brand then it will do great things for the future of Android.\n\nNote: A lot of this is an attempt to look at things from the point of view of an average consumer. I have absolutely no intention of ever buying a non-Nexus device, and I'll explain to anyone I meet at length why this is so, but my point is that most consumers don't get to meet me or don't care.\n\n\n"}

The only issue with all of this is that at the moment, land-masses aren't really large enough to accommodate rivers or lakes. As we've seen from that post where the guy generated an absolutely massive world just so see what it looked like on a large scale, it's too uniform and noisy in my opinion. All the land features (and biomes, but that's a different subject) need to be scaled up. Otherwise, practically every river will get straight to the sea without having any space to meander and do interesting things.\n\nI think the whole idea of rivers really hinges on erosion. In the first test I did, the water source flowed out in too wide a fashion to really be a river and it looked unnatural and garish. If there were some sort of erosion it would mean that terrain such as that would form a river instead of that strange formation."}

But call them streams, or call them rivers, they both achieve the same aesthetic purpose.\n\nWould you care to elaborate more on what you think needs to be changed for proper water formations to occur?"}

Erosion alone couldn't achieve what you're suggesting though. We'd also need to have water filling things, which in of itself would be a major addition to the game. From reading about dwarf fortress it seems that it wouldn't be terribly difficult to implement. Erosion could be similarly easy. Simply letting flowing water have a random chance of destroying the block under it and letting the chance depend on the speed of the flowing water (as determined by the local slope) would be a decent implementation in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you think about using melt-water as the source of rivers?"}

If it were spread out over a larger region so that the drop was more gradual then would you classify it as a river?\n\nEDIT: Looking at some of your other posts I can see what you're talking about. You'd like flat, narrow bodies of water meandering through the countryside. I don't think that's really a river. It's just a flat, narrow lake. A river loses altitude as it runs its course. It starts high and ends up in the sea.\n\nAnd we already kind of have this in the form of the ocean. But because of the scale of the landmasses, it comes out looking like the dry land is a bunch of tightly packed islands embedded in a huge ocean. If we eventually got large expanses of ocean then would you be content with having smaller rivers flowing through them at sea level?

In fact, if water's losing one block of heigh for ever block it travels horizontally then it's running at a 45 degree angle. How can you call that a waterfall? Waterfalls are when water flows down a sheer drop of 5 or 10 tiles in my opinion. And perhaps the examples I've created fall off very quickly, but if the distance which water is allowed to flow from it's nearest descent were larger, you could get more gradually dropping rivers.\n\nBut you still haven't really told me what you want in a river? If you just want a long, flat expanse of water, we already have them.\n\nEDIT: Again, after reading some more of your posts I think I see what you're saying. What you're suggesting is kind of unrealistic though. You're asking for water to flow and carry you in a particular direction even though it's flat. I think that wouldn't be a very good or realistic addition, because frankly it's impossible in real life.

This is what the LM317 is for.\n\n* The effective resistance of the LM317 is determined by the amount of resistance between the output and adjustment pins. This effective resistance is what gives you the resultant lower voltage that you use to drive your fan (lower relative to the input voltage from the AC-DC converter that you're getting your power from).\n\n* Hence, my understanding is that the two different combinations of pot and fixed resistor are just different ways of adjusting this output voltage. Perhaps the 2K ohm pot gives you a wider range of control, but less granularity since the throw of the pot is probably the same.\n\nI'm pretty sure I used a 2K ohm pot, and my stirplate will kick the stirbar when the pot is only about 1/3rd of the way towards the maximum position. So maybe the 1K ohm option gives you a little more fine control? However my setup isn't bad enough to make the stirplate unusable by any means, so I figure it probably doesn't matter."}

As a kit with the 18-105mm lens it's $1600. By all accounts this is an *alright* lens, but let's just say that after 6 months of shooting with it you decide you'd like a prime for some better image quality or better low light performance.\n\nSo you figure you'll get a Nikon 35mm f1.8G which is about $200. After another few months of using that, you love it so much you want another fast prime. Perhaps you miss the long end of your 18-105 but you'd like the sharpness of a prime. So you buy the Nikon 85mm f1.8 for about $400. So all up you've now spent $2200 on your gear. By this point, you realise that you like your primes much more than your 18-105 so it mostly sits at home.\n\nThe other upgrade path is that you buy the body only for $1200 and get the 35 f1.8 immediately. Initial outlay is $1400, so if you decide after 6 months that you don't like photography you've actually spent less money than the kit for a better lens. If you do like it then you grab the 85mm after a few months and your total cost is $2000. That's a saving of $200 (that could go towards a decent speedlight) and you end up with exactly the same gear."}

{"created_utc":"1378126500","score":"4","subreddit":"TheoryOfReddit","body":"&gt; This is where similarities between the two sites begin to fall apart. Because a subreddit is not equivalent to a forum. To elaborate, consider the notion of subscribing to a sub. One subscribes to a multitude of different subreddits to make up one's front page. A subreddit is a constituent part of the whole, whereas a board on 4chan is the whole. The main event, so to speak.\n\nAlthough this may be true for a casual Reddit user, as a self proclaimed experienced Reddit user, I primarily browse by subreddit.\n\nThat is, if I've got 5 minutes to spend on Reddit, then I'll just scan the front page. My motivation here is really just to make sure I don't miss any gigantic news in one of the subreddits I'm subbed to.\n\nBut if I've got more time than this (which is the normal case) then I'll go through each individual subreddit, one at a time.\n\nI do this because my front page acts as a general repository for anything I'm currently interested in, but also for subjects where my interest may have waned. On the other hand, the subreddits that I frequent are frequented because they're my current active interests.\n\nSo in this sense, subreddits are basically like forums on 4chan, although I'd argue that I have less loyalty to a particular subreddit than you claim people have to 4chan boards.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAnother issue I see with your analysis is that although you might be able to go to a different sub if you don't like the current sub, in some instances there is no sub to go to, and attempting to create one would be futile.\n\nFor example, in the case of /r/hombrewing (which I frequent), it would be almost impossible to break off a group of users into a new subreddit more aligned with a particular concept or idea (eg. all grain brewing) simply because there are not enough sub-categories of homebrewing to generate sufficient discussion.\n\n---------------\n\nFinally, I disagree with your last sentence.\n\n&gt; It's no wonder, then, that dedicated redditors are often dissatisfied with the state of discourse and community of subreddits.\n\nIn my experience, the reasons for veteran members of a subreddit to be unhappy with that subreddit are:\n\n* Poor management. See /r/android a few months ago. There were loads of threads complaining about general dissatisfaction with the rules about promotion of apps, and lots of complaints about how bad the mods are. (As a side note, I predicted what would happen there pretty well. All of these complaints came at a time where news in the Android space was pretty low. Now that there's been a flurry of new releases and interesting developments, these threads have basically evaporated. The complaints were basically a manifestation of the collective boredom of the sub. I'd be interested to hear if anybody else has witnessed this phenomenon).\n\n* Perceived drop in quality of content or disinterest with the most commonly posted content. An example of this is /r/tf2 and /r/truetf2. The people who were interested in the finer points of the actual gameplay and mechanics of TF2 splintered off into /r/truetf2 to escape what they perceived as too many memes and jokes.\n\n* Being overwhelmed by opinions against their own. Basically, veteran members are more likely to be 'further down the rabbit hole' (so to speak) with regards to the interests of the subreddit. For example, if I became an avowed and passionate advocate of espresso over all other forms of coffee, I could see the discussion in /r/coffee (where cheap but excellent devices like the Hario V60 or the Aeopress are suggested over spending lots of money on an espresso machine) being incredibly aggravating. Now I doubt this would ever happen to me (because I don't have hundreds or thousands of dollars to spend on espresso machines) but I could see people finding it frustrating.\n\nAlthough now that I read back those three points, it seems that perhaps they're all caused by the phenomenon you describe of casual participation being the norm on Reddit."}

She got on the phone with an Apple support rep and apparently talked to him for 2 hours (she said he lived in Denver and his parents moved there when he as a child) and after all that time it turned out her internet had been shaped because she'd been watching too many videos.\n\nThe point is, having somebody to call for help who speaks English and is friendly is great for old people.\n\nFeatures wise, I think Android is actually superior to iOS for almost everything, but especially for people who are not good with technology. Example: My GFs Dad bought an iPhone. He doesn't know how to type using a QWERTY keyboard because he's never had to use one before. If it were Android, you could install a custom keyboard that was alphanumeric like on the old dumbphones, but with iOS your shit out of luck."}

There's probably foods that you loved as a child and don't like now, and visa-versa. At the very least there will be foods that you like more or less.\n\nThe other thing that naturally happens with time is that we can pick more subtle and nuanced flavours. For example, ask a young kid if he prefers lamb or beef and he'll probably just tell you he likes meat and hates eating veggies. As time goes on we start to get better at noticing texture and flavour, so by the time you're an adult you can tell whether you prefer beef or chicken, and whether you like free range or caged better (and if you get really crazy and become a chef you might start to notice that chickens from one farm taste better than the other because of additional factors like diet and breed and so on). The exact same thing will happen with wine if you give it time and make sure you're critically assessing the flavours in what you're drinking.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to trust your *own* palate and learn what *you* like.

Otherwise, go to a really good butcher and get some high quality ground beef with a fair amount of fat in it.\n\nTake your beef, salt it and roll it into a big sausage with the same cross section as you want your pattie to have. Wrap it tightly in cling film and stick it in the fridge for a few hours to firm up. Use a sharp knife to cut the patties from the roll. Now that the patties are cut, lay them on some baking paper and let them come up to room temperature.\n\nCook on a searingly hot grill, and turn it every 30 seconds to a minute. When it's almost done, grab a slice of cheese and put it on top, then throw a metal bowl over the top and lower the heat.

If you're just using beef and salt then there are no other flavorings to hide behind.\n\n* You don't need egg or other crap to get your pattie to stick together. Salt naturally binds the proteins of the mince together, as long as you use enough and give it enough time.\n\n* Let the patties come up to room temperature and cook them really hot.

The same goes for fast internet or any sort of emerging technology.\n\nIt's the same as somebody 30 years ago seeing the internet and saying 'yeah, so what'. When the internet was invented nobody imagined the sorts of things it's enabled.\n\nThe only thing we can do with a new sort of technology is look at how it differs from traditional technologies, and determine whether those differences are significant or not. This isn't perfect, because if you apply this line of reasoning to the internet when it first began, you still don't get to where we are today. But it's as good as we can get.\n\nThe first thing that is exciting about 3D printing is that it allows for a wide range of shapes to be created, and the shapes you can create are not highly dependant on the skill of the operator. The second exciting thing is that with the internet it's very easy to share designs for different items. The final thing that's significantly different from existing manufacturing processes is that modifying objects is extremely easy. If you're mass producing plastic cups and you want to change the design, my understanding is that you probably need to have an entirely new mould made at very great expense.\n\nAll of these things together give me a sense that 3D printing is going to be a really exciting space, because they enable things significantly different from what we can currently do. But I can't know for sure, and either can you."}

You're well within your right to refuse, but then you can't come in. The problem is, I have no way of physically stopping you from coming in. If I try and hold you back I'll get charged with assault. I could try and prosecute you for trespass or breach of conditions of entry, but it would probably get thrown out unless I had some good proof, and at the same time it's probably not worth my while. So the sign is useless.\n\nHowever, let's say that you submit to a bag check on your way in, and then you steal something in the store, and then refuse a bag check on your way out. I can either detain you and call the police. If you've indeed stolen something then you're screwed. However, if you haven't then I'm screwed and will probably get sued.\n\nSo in the end, the sign is completely, unless (as I said before) I'm 100% sure that you've stolen something.

{"created_utc":"1386047855","score":"1","subreddit":"beer","body":"This is such a ridiculously hard topic to discuss, because there are two conflicting points.\n\nOn the one hand, I understand why people would like a craft beer definition. It's because people want to know what their product is. It's all well and good to make *reduction ad absurdum* arguments like\n\n&gt; You can really tell the brewery makes less than 6 million barrels per year. It's so small batchy!\n\nbut this is actually something people might care about. I'd much rather support brewers who take care and have pride in their products than faceless multinationals, because beyond just enjoying their beer, I feel like I'm forging a relationship with people and a brand.\n\nOn the other hand, trying to actually come up with a workable definition that encompasses everybody who clearly should be called craft beer, excludes those that clearly shouldn't, accommodates those that could go either way and leaves the door open for future breweries to be slotted into the right category is basically impossible.\n\nI'm not really involved in the industry other than drinking, so I can only comment from the perspective of a consumer. But as a consumer in the largely beer-uneducated country that is Australia, I see the distinction (or lack thereof) between craft beer and 'other' beer as largely one of personal frustration.\n\nNo, it doesn't matter if somebody is buying what they think is craft beer and enjoying it. Drink what you like, and trust your palate. That's all that matters.\n\nBut what frustrates me is that I feel a lack of distinction leads to consumers missing out on some of the incredible beer that is becoming increasingly easy to buy in Australia. Basically, my thesis is that by buying beer that masquerades as craft beer when it really isn't, consumers feel like it isn't really worth their while to explore other more interesting beers.\n\nWe in this sub all know how incredible beer can taste, but the average macro drinker probably doesn't. I think there's a cultural perception (at least in Australia) that beer is beer is beer. Unlike wine, where even if you've never had a $1000 bottle of wine, you at least appreciate that expensive wine exists and that it is probably very delicious (even if you can't appreciate the flavours), most of the people I know just consider beer as beer. There's one type, it's fizzy and it's good on a cold day.\n\nSo if you take this average drinker and give them a beer which is only very slightly better than what they're used to, I'd say there's almost no chance that you're going to convince them that the extra money is worth it. This is what the lack of distinction can lead to. You think you're buying something different, but in reality you're not. By extension I'd guess this could lead to people essentially giving up on other beers and going back to whatever they are used to drinking.\n\nOn the other hand, if you give them a really excellent beer then there's a chance that they will be convinced to spend a little more, and I'd wager there's a higher chance than if they were given a not significantly better beer.\n\nThat's what frustrates me most about the craft/non-craft distinction. A lack of a clear distinction leads to consumers who can't understand why everybody is making such a big fuss over really great beer, because they've never actually had really great beer."}

She adds some rice to the stock and boils until it's cooked. \n\nMeanwhile, she takes a few egg whites and beats them until they're fairly frothy and creamy, but still liquid. She then adds some lemon juice to the soup and to the egg mixture, and then slowly adds the hot soup while still beating in order to temper the whites so that they don't coagulate. Once you've added most of the soup and the egg whites are tempered, mix the eggwhite-soup mixture back into the rest of the soup and rice. Add more lemon juice to taste.

Android currently suffers not only from OS version fragmentation, but from fragmentation of mind share. People don't realise that whether you buy an HTC, Samsung, Sony, Huawei or any other phone, you're still getting Android. All the apps are the same, the way things work are basically the same (excluding skinning) and if you've got all your data linked to your Google account, that's backed up and synced across your Chrome browser, all your Android devices and your future devices.\n\nThe other effect would be due to the ubiquity of unskinned Android, Google would get much more recognition for the fantastic design sense they've developed since ICS.

They exist because it's easily possible to make Android run acceptably on lower priced hardware. Yes, there is competition driving the price down, but that's not the reason for different price points in the first place.\n\n&gt; I say that because the Nexus 4 camera sucks and the battery life isn't far behind and there is nothing special besides the Google subsidized price and the frequent updates. Go ahead and strip away all other Android phones and compare it purely to an iPhone or Nokia Lumia and it's still subpar.\n\nThe Nexus 4 was extremely high end when it was released. No, it's camera isn't great. But the fact that it has stock Android is the single most important feature. You spend 100% of your time with a smartphone interacting with the OS, and stock Android is the best looking, cleanest and fastest version out there, and it gets better with every update.\n\nWhen we see Android version 5, everybody is going to be in love with Nexus devices again. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 this month have made everybody forget how much it sucks to be a major Android version behind. But it will happen. You can argue that Google are trying to disconnect the Google apps from the OS version, but I'm sure there are going to be look and feel and under-the-hood improvements that make Android 5 stand out, and people with non-Nexus devices are going to be left behind for 6 months at least.\n\n&gt; Apparently Samsung's \"gimmicks\" were more than enough for most people since software features sell better than \"pure android\" does, and even on the hardware spectrum a Samsung phone is better than the Nexus.\n\nSamsung sell lots of phones because of their good marketing. HTC make better hardware *and* software, yet they sell poorly because they don't market well. Google's phones sell even worse because they do almost no marketing, although the Nexus 7 is actually doing great because it's in lots of retailers and it's got great hardware and is marketed a little.\n\nTo say that Samsung's hardware is better than the Nexus hardware is absurd. Samsung certainly puts better cameras in their devices, but their screens are not necessarily better, and neither are their SOCs. As far as aesthetics are concerned, Samsung is hell bent on cheap, shitty plastic while the Nexus 4 (and from the leaks, the Nexus 5) have much better design and higher quality materials."}

However, as the topic says, if there was only ONE phone line in the entire world running Android, that wouldn't be the case. Unless Google was willing to mega-gamble on their phone line and spend billions more in acquiring manufacturing, better R&amp;D, and advertising for a phone they'll sell at a low price, which wouldn't happen.\n\nYou're twisting the topic. It's not 'What would happen if all of the current OEMs disappeared and only Google was left?'. It's 'What would happen if Google were the only OEM right from the beginning?'. Huge difference. Google doesn't care about selling heaps of devices at the moment, because it doesn't need to. Samsung does that for them, and they make thousands of times more money from ads and services than hardware.\n\nIf they were the only OEM then they would at least have an incentive to sort out manufacturing, R&amp;D and advertising. They might not succeed, but they'd have incentive. And they would also produce phones at different price points, because the market has demanded that since forever.\n\n&gt; It's the cleanest and fastest because it's barebones. You get nothing extra. That's why it's also cheaper to make, because there's little R&amp;D that needs to go into software that isn't already being done with kitkat/jellybean.\n\nYou're trying to tell me that Samsung are improving Android more than Google themselves? Get real. Samsung's gimmicks are turned off by most people, and the rest don't even realise they're there. You can't honestly believe that Samsung are innovating in software more than Google. Once again, wait until Android 5.0. The only reason you think Samsung are innovating is because Google hasn't been releasing many user facing features since 4.1, where as Samsung are just pushing whatever half baked shit they can come up with out the door as fast as they can.\n\n&gt; They do worse because it doesn't have anything that jumps out at people.\n\nThey do worse because Google doesn't care *at all* whether they sell or not. It's entirely marketing.\n\nSamsung have great marketing, and they have a gigantic budget for marketing which means they can plaster every billboard, bus stop, TV screen and banner ad with their products.\n\nHTC have pretty mediocre to horrible marketing, and they seem to devote less money to getting their ads out there.\n\nGoogle have no marketing because they make their money of ads and services. But their ads are actually pretty good. Its pretty clear that you're feature obsessed, because you love Samsungs shovelware, but if you compare the Nexus ads to Apple's ads you'll see similarities. They're all about how the device is going to improve your life, and they tug the heart strings a little.\n\nSo to summarise:\n\n* We're talking about where we'd be if Google was the only Android OEM right from the start.\n* Pricepoints are created by the market, not by competition.\n* People are enjoying a time where Android updates are relatively minor on the frontend. This will change and you'll be sorry if you didn't get a Nexus device.\n* Google's advertising is pretty good, but they don't advertise much at all. They have the money to, and if they were the only OEM they'd plaster every surface of your city and every online surface in their services with their own ads."}

There's a difference between price points or price tiers, and the actual prices of those tiers. In the US you have a $299, $199, $99 and $0 price points. The actual quality and performance of hardware in those pricepoints is driven down over time by competition, but newer, better hardware takes its place at the top end.\n\n&gt; I simply pointed out that Samsung offers more features ON TOP of Android than the Nexus does alone. Multi-window is pretty cool; is that going to be in Android 5.0? If so, who cares? Samsung, LG, Sony, HTC, and everyone else will have the best of both worlds.\n\nYou clearly don't remember what happened when 4.0 was released. It took aaaaaaages for OEMs to figure their shit it.

It's much softer and lighter in texture than store bought tuna and has a wonderful rich taste.\n\n* Tomatoes - home grown is the ultimate. Home grown black russian tomatoes are the uber ultimate. Sadly they were out of season when I made this sandwich so I had to use store bought which are never as flavorsome.\n\n* Pickles - I prefer a savory dill pickle, the name of the brand escapes me as we're out of them at the moment.\n\n* A black olive, pickled halepeno and garlic tapenade that I'd prepared a few days earlier. My family gets a shipment of real kalamata olives from a family plantation in kalamata every year. The halepenos were pickled by myself.\n\n* Some nice red onion.\n\n* A drizzle of good greek olive oil and some salt and pepper (the tuna didn't have salt in it because it was home made, otherwise you'd probably omit it).\n\nPure bliss for the few days that I had enough of the ingredients to make it (the halepenos started to run out, as did the tuna)\n\nAnother one of my favorites that I at frequently was a spicy tuna mix (I love tuna, so most of my sandwiches involve it in some way. Plus, we always have some).\n\nI'd take about 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a bowl, and into that mix a ground cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, tumeric and cumin (all to taste) and stir that all until it formed a thick paste. Then I'd add the tuna and mix until it was coated the the thick orange-red paste. Then I'd add diced pieces of tomato and spread that on bread with perhaps some pickle slices on top. Wonderful.\n\nJust a few of my 'go to' sandwiches."}

I don't really meet many of the criteria, but I figure it's worth a shot.\n\nI've been an Android user for over a year, and in that time I've been heavily following every release and fragment of news.\n\nI own a Galaxy Nexus and a Nexus 7, and I'm heavily into the ROM and custom kernel scene.\n\nAlthough I'm not the most experienced Android user, I feel the area that I could help most in is post moderation. In contrast to other people's hardline views, I think discussion about US carriers and discussions about Apple have their place, but need to be carefully moderated.\n\nYes, posts that are only relevant to people embroiled in the mess that is the US cellular market are useless here, but it can be a fine line. In particular news such as big carriers not picking up flagships, or the Nexus 4 not launching with LTE on any carrier deserves to be here. The US market is so large and influential that decisions such as not carrying certain devices have ramifications far outside the US. Also, we've been repeatedly told that *carriers* and not OEMs are the reason for custom skins, which serves to further the link between carriers and Android.\n\nOn the topic of Apple, again, it can be a fine line. Clearly, posts that only serve to bash Apple and its products are not alright, but discussion (even heated discussion) about relative merits of Android and Apple in the context of some wider story can provide valuable discussion, and should not be quashed.\n\nOn the discussion of legal issues affecting Android, they are very relevant and should be here. The outcome of cases such as Apple v Samsung have the potential to affect sales of Android devices or to alter the course of Android development. There's no reason why this content shouldn't be here.\n\nFinally, whoever started Moronic Monday is a genius! This has helped to lower the number of 'newbie questions' found in /r/android. The solution to the large number of 'what ROM to flash?', 'what phone to buy?', 'what are the coolest features?' etc. type questions is not to ban them, but to aggregate them like we did with Moronic Monday. I know /r/androidquestions exists, but the excuse I've heard many times for posts in /r/android is that /r/androidquestions has a far lower readership than /r/android. So why not have other 'named' days of the week with a simple link over to a post on /r/androidquestions eg. 'Tuesday Buyers Roundup' or similar with discussion on what the current favored phones are.\n\nI'm located in Melbourne, Australia and my timezone is AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)."}

That aside, here's what I've been doing:\n\n* Buy basics. You're probably not going to fit into them in a few months with any luck, so probably don't drop too much money on stuff.\n\n* That being said, don't be afraid to buy nice stuff that will still fit you when you lose weight. This means shoes, watches, sunglasses, any other accessories you can think of. I know I'm overweight and dress in really basic shit like t-shirts and jeans, but I feel pretty good about myself because I know I'm wearing a nice watch and a good quality pair of shoes, and the rest of the stuff fits me reasonably well. Sometimes it's more about how you feel rather than how you look.\n\n* Buy stuff slowly. Don't go out and buy a million things at once just because MFA said so, even if this is tempting. From the looks of it you need a new pair of jeans (don't be afraid of slim or skinny fits, they look good even if you don't think you fall into those categories), some shirts that fit you better, and maybe some new shoes. Buy one pair of jeans, one pair of chinos, a few plain colored shirts and one pair of shoes and go from there.\n\n* Learn to think about color. This is something that I had really no concept of before I made a decision to start dressing better. There's stuff in the sidebar about this, but really study what you're wearing to see if the colors match or clash. Also, don't be afraid of lighter colors. Don't be afraid of contrast (dark blue shirt with cream or white pants).\n\n* Get stuff altered. If you have a sewing machine, hemming pants isn't that hard. Otherwise, take them to a tailor. With jeans, you can roll them if you like or again take them to a tailor. It makes a big difference to how you look when you get rid of the stacks of excess fabric at the bottom of dress pants. Same goes for shirts. As you'll see in all of the fit guides, make sure they fit you at the shoulders and then get the rest fixed up by a tailor.\n\n* Layer lots. You said you live in SoCal, so you're in winter right now. What I'd fucking give to be in winter again. Sweaters and jackets are you friend because they help to hide your belly a little bit, or at the very least break up the silhouette so that you don't seem quite as round.\n\nHope that helps a little."}

{"created_utc":"1382936801","score":"49","subreddit":"starcitizen","body":"This is an interesting discussion to have, but I think the point of it is somewhat missed by the guy who made the video.\n\nStar Citizen will almost certainly obey Newtonian mechanics. I don't see any way in which it cannot, because if you stop obeying Newton's laws of motion that we're familiar with, flight is going to seem incredibly unrealistic.\n\nThe question we want to know is twofold. Firstly, how will controls in spaceflight work? And secondly, will engine outputs behave in realistic ways.\n\nLets look at the first question. We've seen from very early on that Star Citizen aims to be very intricate in the way it simulates space craft. You're going to have a main thruster at the rear of your ship, perhaps some retro-thrusters at the front, and some number of maneuvering thrusters on your ship which may or may not be able to vector the thrust.\n\nSo the question becomes, how do you control potentially 12 or 14 different thrusters. The answer is, you need some sort of 'fly-by-wire' system. Chris Roberts has mentioned that this is how things are going to work. What 'fly-by-wire' means is basically that you don't directly control the thrusters themselves, but instead you tell the ship what you want it to do and then it figures out how to vector the thrusters and with what power to thrust at to get you where you need to go. The alternative to this is that you need separate controls for each thruster's power, and you also need a way to rotate each thruster independently of any others. For 14+ thrusters this would be an absolute nightmare.\n\nNow this doesn't mean that you're violating Newtonian mechanics. It's just a different way to control things.\n\nThe most natural way is to control things is the way we do with terrestrial flight. You have a pitch, yaw and roll axis, and you have a throttle. The advantage of this is that it's familiar to most people and it's fairly easy to pick up. The disadvantage is that there are many maneuvers that are not possible on the ground, but are possible in space. So what you can do is add to that controls for horizontal and vertical translation.\n\nBut now we run into another problem. See in the atmosphere, there is friction. So if you thrust forward, eventually you'll slow down to to air resistance. This is not so in space, and this is basically what this video is getting at. So what happens?\n\nThe first option is that if you thrust forward, you just keep moving forward for ever. This is what the guy who made the video is thinking of when he says 'Newtonian mechanics'. However the other equally valid option is that when you thrust forward, you start accelerating, but when you stop thrusting forward, the 'fly-by-wire' system interprets that as 'I want to slow down' and it *automatically* starts firing the retro thrusters to slow you down.\n\nThe difference is subtle, but important. In one, the throttle is being interpreted simply as 'How much power should the thruster be delivering'. In the other, the throttle is basically what velocity you want to travel at. The other consideration is how quickly this will occur. What would be tantamount to violating Newtonian mechanics is if you thrust forward for 10 minutes at full throttle but then you can somehow slow to a stop in 10 seconds. Again, this doesn't violate Newtonian mechanics, but what it implies is that your retro thruster is **vastly** more powerful than your rear thruster, because it just counteracted 10 minutes of acceleration in 10 seconds. Thankfully, this seems to be something that the Star Citizen team are acutely aware of and will account for, given how much detail and thought they've put into the engine system.\n\nUnfortunately, it gets even more complicated because this also applies to thrusting in *any* direction. So if I thrust to the right (thus pushing my craft left) should I continue to move to the left after I've finished thrusting, or should it automatically slow down?\n\nSo what's the point of all of this useless rambling?\n\nWell firstly, Star Citizen is going to obey Newtonian mechanics. That's basically a given. Secondly, what we *really* need is a system that caters to everybody. Some people are going to want to just fly like an aircraft using pitch, yaw, roll, throttle and maybes some translation. That should be fine. Some people (like me) are going to go out and buy HOTAS systems and they might want to be able to turn off the fly-by-wire system selectively, or directly control thrusters in certain circumstances in order to get the maximum maneuverability out of their craft. That should be possible as well.\n\nNow the part of me that loves tweaking and customizing stuff would ***absolutely love*** some sort of interface whereby you could take all of your control inputs (mouse, keyboard, joystick, POV hats etc.) and individually map them with different sensitivity curves and combinations of inputs to a combination of 'fly-by-wire' outputs (such as pitch, yaw, roll etc.) as well as individual thruster outputs if you want. This would be incredibly dense, complex to master but perhaps not impossible to do, since you'd just be accessing the fly-by-wire code that already exists, plus the individual thruster outputs which the fly-by-wire code is already manipulating. Damn that would be awesome if you could customise your controls to suit your particular peripherals, and you should share profiles and tweak them with others. But we'll have to wait and see.\n\n**tl;dr** This isn't a question of Newtonian mechanics. It's a question of how the controls will work.\n\nEDIT:  This link from /u/Seclorum explains how CR intends for it to work. \n\nhttps://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/618968/#Comment_618968\n\nBasically, the BSG maneuver demonstrated in the video is specifically called out as being something that should work. You'll be able to go into a mode that will only rotate your vessel instead of trying to move your velocity vector to match your nose. No word on translation controls, but I could live without them. The thrust controls will be basically akin to setting how fast you want to go, not literal control over forward and rear thrusters.\n\nAlso, there are lots of people stressing that this 'orientation mode' (as CR calls it) will be an upgrade. I think the emphasis on it being an upgrade is wrong. I can't see why this would be a particularly expensive upgrade. I'd guess it would be pretty low tier, because at the end of the day it is going to offer an advantage, but at the same time that advantage is going to require significant skill to make use of. Things don't need to be super expensive if their benefit is very limited by your skill. After all, this is going to be a very skill based game."}

So much incredible stuff, can't wait for next year.\n\nBottled beer wise:\n\n**Dainton Black Sheep Smokey Stout**: Squealer from TruBru via Grape and Grain. Ultra smokey, but otherwise lacking complexity. Not bad.\n\n**Kaiju Metamorphosis**: Loving Kaiju's work. A balanced IPA with some pretty delicious caramelised sugar notes. I have a bottle of Where Strides the Behemoth which I'm looking forward to after trying it at GABS.\n\n**Stillwater Cellar Door**: Exceptional. Very complex yet all of the flavors mingle into a continuum.\n\n**Two Meter Tall Huon Dark Apple Ale**: Interesting. Not particularly malty, but certainly very tart and funky.\n\n**Mornington Sorachi Kolsch**: Outrageous amounts of dill pickle. Sorachi is such a crazy hop. I got none of the bubblegum in this one and all of the dill, yet I've had beers with crazy bubblegum and no dill.\n\n**Clown Shoes Undead Party Crasher**: Sweet, quite smokey, but a very flavorsome smoke if that makes sense. Great. Also, an interesting story behind the name and the label.\n\n**Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout**: Really velvety and smooth mouthfeel from the fine carbonation. Really good.\n\n**La Sirene Fleur Folie**: Pretty good.\n\n**BrewCult Acid Freaks**: Very interesting. Much less sour than I was expecting. Complex. The vinegar flavor is there but not crazy.\n\n**Bridge Road Bling IPA**: Solid. Glad I finally got around to trying this.\n\n**BrewCult Get Down American Brown**: Stellar as always.\n\n**2 Brothers Creme Caramel**: I have to mention this, because I had a fill at GABS, and then after lamenting the fact that it had a big X over it when I went to the brewery, it miraculously came on tap later in the night. So ridiculously good.\n\n**2 Brothers Growler**: I've had this before, and never thought much of it. But fresh from the tap at the brewery it was really incredible. Great balance of malt and hops, lots of nice caramel notes and some zesty citrus. Perhaps I just had old bottles last time?\n\n**Etienne Dupont Cidre Bouch\u00e9 Brut de Normandie**: You need to try this right now if you're a fan of proper French cider. Tart, appley, funky, really delicious. If you're a saison or sour fan, get on this. It's literally as far away as that sweet yellow fizzy stuff that passes for cider in Australia.\n\nOh, and the best part? You can find this at *Dan Murphy's* of all places. I've bought out all the stock at my local one, but I just visited another one nearby and it has half a dozen. Go and see if you can find some, it's well worth it. It's imported by Phoenix, but apparently Dan's have stopped stocking it. Fingers crossed that doesn't mean it's stopped being imported, because I'd love a regular supply of it.\n\n**Edit:** Went to my local Dan's today, and to my surprise they had gotten new stock of this amazing cider. I asked the guy at the counter and he confirmed that they'd indeed gotten new stock today, and that it was still in the system. It's definitely not on the website, and if you Google 'Dan Murphys Etienne Dupont' you can find the page that lists it as discontinued.

The sooner you do this the better, because if somebody is poor at communicating during the first few weeks, it's doubtful that they'll suddenly improve over the semester. Find a similar course from another university. Find a book that's good, and start following it **from the beginning**. I emphasise that you need to start the book from the beginning because often a book will explain things in a completely different way from your lecturer so jumping into a book for bits and pieces of the course that don't make sense can be incredibly difficult when you're looking at different notation and reasoning.\n\nSecondly, keep notes from past years, and don't be afraid to refer to them. I've struggled at times because things that are assumed knowledge in later years may have been taught poorly or you're just a little rusty. In a perfect world, every lecturer would explain everything perfectly, passing a course would indicate mastery of every piece of subject matter and every lecturer would have a refresher on the assumed knowledge at the beginning of their subject. In my experience,  all of these almost never happen.\n\nIt's really just one point that's at play here. As my 7th grade math teacher used to say 'mathematics is like building a house.

The technology involved is implemented in a very stupid way. The following information is what I gleaned from a thread on this a little while ago.\n\nBasically, the myki system treats the actual myki card as an unreliable source.\n\nSo when you're touching on and off, the myki reader is looking up your myki ID in a database somewhere and making sure that you've got enough money to touch on, and deducting the money when you touch off. This means that tampering with you myki and adding extra money to it is useless, because the server is always checked, so the discrepancy will be noticed immediately. This seems good, but the downside is that the system  has to wait for a request to travel to the servers, the data to be looked up and then the data to be returned to the reader for a verdict. This can be, and evidently is, slow.\n\nThe more sensible option would be to treat the card as a credible source. You touch on, the reader reads how much money is on your myki and makes a decision based on that. Then, at a time that is convenient the data is synchronised with the servers. The downside of this is that if you tampered with a myki, the tampering would not be detected until the reader synchronised with the servers and noticed a discrepancy (which could be up to a day). The upshot is that it's extremely fast.\n\nWhy the myki consortium chose to implement the first method and not the second is beyond me. The second system also fixes the issue of poor wireless signal causing myki readers on buses and trams to not work. You just sync the data when the bus/tram gets back to the depot at the end of the day.\n\nFinally, the issue of using an off the shelf system also had an interesting explanation in the thread I read. The current myki cards have the option of being used as a micro-payment system. But if you use an off the shelf system, then any  revenue generated by the system goes to whoever designed the system. By making our own system, the money goes to whoever designed it.\n\nI should probably add that this could all be wrong. It's just what I read, and it made sense to me, so I figured I'd re post it here. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n"}

Basically, you're steaming them but with oil instead of water. The benefit is you don't lose all the flavour of the broccoli to the cooking water. Sprinkle with dried chilli if you like some spice, or just some salt and pepper.\n\n* Asparagus: Basically the same as broccoli.\n\n* Carrots: Also the same, but add a tiny bit of butter and a sprinkle of sugar for extra sweetness.\n\n* Peas: Don't just throw the frozen peas in the microwave. All you need to do is lay them out on some paper towel and put them in an oven until they've defrosted and heated through. Just make sure you take them out before you set your oven on fire. If you let them defrost without the paper towel then all the the water that is left behind takes most of the flavour with it too. You'll be surprised how sweet and delicious frozen peas can be.\n\nDon't be put off by the fact that you're using oil.

The education system (at least at the primary and high school levels) isn't doing a good enough job of producing critical thinkers.\n\nFunding might be the problem. In 2009 we spent 18.8% of GDP per capita per secondary school pupil. Contrast this with Finland who are widely held to have the best education system in the world with 36.1% of GDP per capita per secondary school pupil. So basically double our spending. The UK isn't far behind with 31% and the US with 25.3%\n\nBut I think another issue is education level of teachers and motivation for the best and brightest to become teachers. In Finland, you have to have a Masters degree in order to teach. This is necessarily going to produce a higher quality teacher than those we employ in Australia. By gaining a Masters degree they've shown that they're able to think critically and reason, an attribute that I'm sure they pass down to their students. The field is also highly competitive and well paid. Contrast that with the situation in Australia.\n\nThe effect that this has is that students who don't go on to further education (and even those who do) are less likely to be good critical thinkers, and this breeds a new generation of people who go on to educate more poor thinkers."}

{"created_utc":"1369918953","score":"1","subreddit":"beer","body":"There are two issues going on here.\n\nTo answer your question, the fastest way to learn almost anything is through a combination of reading and practice. For alcohol, basically just drink as many different types of alcohol as you can. While you're tasting different types, make sure you are conscious of the differences and similarities between each type. It's fine to not like everything, but you should know exactly why.\n\nThe other issue is: do people really care whether the person who serves them at a liquor store actually knows what they're talking about? Unless it's a specialty store, then I don't really care.\n\nFor example, I have a very large chain liquor store just down the road from me. They are well known for their good wine selection, but their beer selection is poor to average. They've just started getting a few more craft beers and they even have seasonals from some of the larger craft breweries, however they tend to have only the worst and cheapest beers from the smaller breweries. When I go in there I expect absolutely no knowledge of the beer from staff. I was surprised the other day when I asked about a particular seasonal and the guy stacking shelves listed off a few of the previous seasonals by the same brewer and told me they were sold out. However, this is very rare.\n\nIf the store you're going to work at falls into this category, then treat learning about alcohol as something that might make you a bit better at your job (and might improve your employability if you stay in that line of work) but not as something that's essential to your job.\n\nOn the other hand, if I go into an independent craft beer store and I'm not sure what to get, I'd relying on the staff to help me out. If you're at a specialty store, you already know why you're there. You either have specific beers in mind (in which case you want to know exactly where to find them, or if they're sold out you might want a suggestion of something similar) or you are overwhelmed with choice and you'd like some suggestions (which means the staff member needs to be able to ask the right questions so that they can pick out some beer you like).\n\nIf your store falls into this group, then do what I suggested about. Read as much as you can, and drink as much as you can handle and as widely as you can find. This last part shouldn't be too difficult since you'll probably get a discount. Also, you're likely to have a bunch of passionate co-workers. Ask them for help."}

So they just make one phone that adheres to the carrier's wishes and roll it out as an exclusive in the US and on every carrier everywhere else.\n\nThis is a trend that's slowly being bucked by the big OEMs with the S4 and HTC One, but the power that the OEMs have isn't being eroded so quickly."}

This assumes that you're packaging it in a container less than 48 litres and that it's upwards of 3.5% ABV. So if we take a 3.5% beer, the brewery has to pay $1.05 per litre tax. For comparison, in America the excise is a flat $0.06 per litre for the first 7 million litres if you produce under 235 million litres per year, and then $0.15 after that.

Perhaps we would have (and will, when Windows hopefully ditches the old desktop) developed an entirely new way of interacting with our desktops that was superior to the old way if metro was the only option.\n\nIt's a pretty well known result in psychology that if you have too many options, you're actually less satisfied.

{"created_utc":"1401681815","score":"1","subreddit":"photography","body":"&gt; Can someone shed light on the whole DX vs. FX in nikon camera bodies?\n\nSure. It's all related to the physical size of the sensor. DX bodies have a sensor that is roughly 2/3 of the size of an FX sensor. The results is that an FX sensor with the same number of pixels as a DX sensor will necessarily have larger pixels. These capture more light and thus you get better low light performance.\n\nThe other effects is that due to the smaller sensor, a 50mm lens mounted on a DX body will give roughly the same framing as a 75mm lens on an FX body. Note that all Nikon lenses whether they're made for FX or DX are labelled with the 35mm equivalent focal length. The only difference between FX and DX lenses is the size of the image circle, which means that an FX lens will work on a DX body, but not the other way around.\n\n&gt; Is there any way around this?\n\nTake the focal length that you want to shoot at, then divide by 1.5. Eg if you want to shoot at 30mm focal length, you need a 30/1.5=20mm lens. So basically, it's harder to get really really wide on DX. But it's still doable.

I like brewtoad.com.\n\nPick your batch size based on the size of your fermenter minus a bit of room for krausen. Also pick your style. I'll assume IPA since that's what you said you wanted to brew.\n\nIf your local home brew store has a website, get on it and see what products they stock. Pick a brand of light DME and add it to your recipe on brewtoad. Play around with the amount of DME in your recipe until the gravity is in the right range. If you really want to keep costs down it could be a good idea to adjust your batch size so that you get a good starting gravity while only using a single packet of light DME (if your LHBS only offers DME in predetermined sizes like mine does).\n\nNext, pick some hops. Again, if you want to keep cost down and your LHBS only sells hops in predetermined volumes then a single hop will do. Again, you want to try and tweak your hop additions to make the most of the predetermined amount of hops you'll buy. An easy way to get good bittering as well as good flavour and aroma is to add hops at 60 minutes until you get to about 20 IBU below your target IBU figure and then split up your remaining hops evenly between 15 minute, 5 minute, flame out and dry hop additions. Again, tweak here to get the maximum use of your hops. \n\nLastly, pick a yeast. Suggestions would be American Ale I or II from Wyeast, but only because I'm familiar with them. Any American ale yeast would be fine. \n\nAs for actual brew day, other than what you already have you'll need a big pot and something to get your beer from the pot to the fermenter. This could be a funnel of you want to keep costs down. \n\nBoil up your water. As much as will comfortably fit in your pot without boilovers. Add your hops at the correct times, and then add your DME at flameout (to prevent excessive darkening). Now cool it as quickly as possible. A tub filled with ice water is good for this. When it's cooled to pitching temp (which will vary based on your yeast, but is probably about 17C) then transfer it to the fermenter. If you didn't have a large enough pot then top up to your final volume now. Shake your fermenter for 15 minutes to aerate the wort. Pour in your yeast, throw in an airlock, (or just put some foil and a plastic bag over the opening) put it in a dark corner for 3 weeks, throw it in bottles and drink. \n\nNow clearly I've skimmed over about a hundred thousand finer points here.

Devs wont have a chance to develop for it for a year and a half.\n\ntl;dr Smartphones are still moving waaaaaaay too fast for Google to contemplate a 2 year release cycle as long as flagship devices running stock Android are $650.\n\nThe reason we didn't see a new Nexus 7 at IO and the white Nexus 4 is probably just due to missing a deadline for 4.3.

{"created_utc":"1288532893","score":"7","subreddit":"Minecraft","body":"Hopefully this will be fixed, as I think it's a kind of terrible way to do things. I think the solution is rather simple though. Firstly, if a portal (P1) is created that leads to an unsuitable location in the nether world, move it the shortest distance possible so that it is in a safe location (ie not suspended above lava) and not within the ground. This is what happens now I think. Now the reason this creates issues is because since you've moved from the position in the nether that corresponds to the position of P1, P2 (portal in the nether) wants to create a new portal P3 in the real world that corresponds to its location. My solution would be this: once you make a portal in the nether and the corresponding location in the real world is determined (or vice versa), the portals are linked and never change. Only when you create a portal that doesn't have a counterpart is the calculation done to determine where the other portal will come out. This means that in our previous scenario, since P2 had to be moved to an acceptable location, there will be multiple entrances to P2 (P1 and any other portals you make that map to P2) but coming back through P2 you should always end up at P1.\n\nThat wasn't very clear at all, but tl;dr, portals should always be created in connected pairs. Just because you go through a portal that wouldn't usually go to where it's connected to for whatever reason doesn't mean the game should create a new one in the \"correct\" place.\n\nEDIT: I've made a handy dandy quick and dirty gif of how I think things should work. Sure, it creates its own problems by having portals that you can only enter the nether through but not exit, but I think it's predictable and usable. [link](http://imgur.com/VJNZe.gif)"}
{"created_utc":"1288535764","score":"3","subreddit":"Minecraft","body":"Here's my proposed solution.\n\nBasically, the portal from the overworld that creates the portal in the nether world form a pair through which you can travel back and forth through. Any other portals that you create in the overworld and link to an existing nether portal are one way portals, ie. you can travel through from the overworld and they'll spit you out at the nether portal, but in the opposite direction you get out at the original overworld portal.\n\nFor this to work, there would have to be some sort of system to deal with what happens if the original portal in the overworld is dismantled. Perhaps destroying the original portal would cause all of the portals to un-link and you'd have to relink them by travelling through one from the overworld side to determine which is the two way and which are the one ways.\n\nThis gif explains some of this ([link](http://i.imgur.com/VJNZe.gif))"}

{"created_utc":"1288537950","score":"2","subreddit":"Minecraft","body":"I agree with noroom's idea, and I'm still not really understanding why you don't think it would work. It basically means that each 64x80x16 sector in the overworld has a corresponding portal in the nether world.\n\nI don't see how you can break this other than by building a portal which has its two halves in different 64x80x16 sectors, in which case you have two options: pick at random (probably not as good) or make it always point to the portal that corresponds to the north/south/east/west (take your pick) most sector.\n\nAs noroom said, the first portal you make in overworld is two way (ie. going through the portal from the nether side takes you back to the first one) and any other portals in that sector are only one way (ie. they take you to the nether but can't be accessed from the nether).\n\nIf you make a portal in the nether it will always need to make a new portal in the overworld, and then this will be a two way portal and any others you build inside that portals sector in the overworld will be one way.\n\nDestruction of portals would be the only tricky part. You could make it so that if the original (two way) portal is destroyed, the next portal that you go through from the overworld becomes the new two way portal. But what would happen if you destroyed the two way portal and then went to a different sector and tried to travel through the portal that no longer has a two way counterpart? I haven't gotten that figured out yet, but I'm sure there's a way to do it.\n\nFinally, having to move portals because of unsuitable terrain in the nether world could be handled by basically having multiple sectors leading to the same nether portal, and have the original portal that you created in overworld that caused the unsuitable nether portal position be the two way portal.\n\nAll in all I think it's a pretty robust and easy to understand system."}

Sure, you might be deep down, but at least it would simplify things.\n\nIt's funny.

It could be that I haven't been replacing the seals properly, though I think that's unlikely. I think what's more likely is either that they slowly lose pressure over time, or possibly that if you keep them in the fridge for too long, the rubber gets cold and stiffens and perhaps allows gas to escape.\n* You get attached to them, which makes them a pain to give to friends or leave at other people's houses. I don't really care if I lose a few capped bottles because I can easily get more. The range of brands that use swing tops are far narrower than those that use caps.\n* They're an awkward shape, so they don't fit in conventional six pack holders\n* They're a bit of an awkward volume.

You rig them up as OP has done so that flipping one of the four switches gives you one of 00, 01, 10 or 11. At the moment, each bit has it own separate line. Then these data bits go into a parallel to serial shift register. What comes out is basically what you put in, but this way, if you put a 10 in, the output is a 1 followed by a 0 (ie. the data is now in serial form, ie. sequential). Then, you run a single wire from that area to where ever it is that you're doing the track switching. This is where the savings are because you're only running one wire instead of two (or, since this is scalable to any number of bits, one wire instead of potentially 4, 8, 16 etc.). Then, once you get to the track switch, you have a serial to parallel shift register which takes your 00, 10, 01 or 11 and turns it back into two separate values which you then use to do that appropriate track switching.\n\nAt the moment I'm having heaps of trouble making a parallel to serial shift register though.

All I said was that I respond favourably to Notch (and yes, tend to defend him) because I like the way he's handling things at the moment. If that changes then my response toward him will accordingly.\n\nThe fact is, whether you like it or not we both know that there is an implied criticism in what you wrote otherwise you wouldn't have used the emotive language you did. Calling the new features that he's worked hard on 'cool new shit he just dreamed up' and saying that he's doing 'absolutely nothing' to fix bugs are not works you use when you're trying to be factual. Saying that he 'just dreamed up' the features he's adding has a connotation of them being half baked or inferior, and saying that he's doing '**absolutely** nothing' is really much too strong an adverb for just stating facts based on past observation. Finally, if you truly didn't realise that those were words of criticism when you wrote them, you wouldn't have added your little addendum at the bottom reminding us that choosing which bits of code to fix or add is 'his prerogative'.\n\nEven then, I could still believe that you didn't mean to criticism or judge. After all, who goes over an analyses posts people make on reddit? Now that would be *sad*.\n\nWhether it was deliberate or not, the response to your post from a community who seems to be, on the whole, happy with features that Notch is going to add on the 31st, was largely negative. You have to admit that the reason people are responding this was is likely to do with them interpreting your statements in a similar way to how I do, because that's simply the connotations and implications that average redditor associates with your words.\n\nI think this has gone on long enough. Feel free to respond to this, but don't expect a response back. I hope you get some enjoyment out of the 31st update (although nowhere have you said that you don't like the features he's implementing, so I can only hope that you love them as much as I do).\n\nI bid you a good day and perhaps we'll meet again, somewhere in the internets."}

However there are a few points against these features that stand out to me.\n\nFirstly, a lot of them require some sort of modification in your behaviour eg. air-gesture and air-view. Now even though these modifications are small, behaviours and ways of interacting with devices that are already heavily ingrained into us after years of using smartphones are going to require a bit of a benefit in order to offset learning some new behaviours. I think the reason these features seem gimicky is because their benefit does not outweigh the change in behaviour.\n\nThe other thing to consider is the state of Samsung's software and hardware. These features aren't that revolutionary. They alleviate some minor inconveniences, nothing more. Yet instead of making sure their software is elegant and their hardware is sturdy and made of nice materials, Samsung chose to include 20 features that do very little to enhance my day-to-day usage of smartphones."}

It frustrates me when I'm having a great debate with somebody and s/he's getting downvoted and I'm getting upvoted simply because my opinion is the popular one and theirs is not.\n\nThe sorting system (whether that be by best or top) is such that downvoting things that are simply disagreed with but still add value to the conversation leads to less interesting discussions because I don't really have time to wade through thousands of comments.\n\nI think one of the most overlooked things in the whole of Reddit is simply not voting at all. It's been my philosophy for a while to upvote things that are stimulating and interesting, downvote things that are not adding to the conversation, and simply *not voting* on things that are either a combination or neither.

Weak willed mods will bend to community wishes easily while strong will ones will take larger backlash before they do.\n\nA related question here is perhaps: what the effects are of moderation that goes against the communities wishes (formation of splinter subreddits, diminishing of activity in the subreddit, moderator witchunts) and too lax moderation (formation of splinter subreddits, complaint posts asking for more moderation of particular threads, diminished activity)?

Fat Yak is also great, but it has to be very fresh. And by all indications it's hard to find it fresh. But they're both pretty restrained in their hopping rates. There are *much* better pale ales being produced in Australia, and there are many of them.\n\nAlso, what /u/VelvetOnion was getting at is that real hops are more expensive than hop extract. Craft beer using all malt and lots of hops is more expensive in terms of raw materials. \n\n&gt; The trouble that we face is that breweries startup with small systems and justify high costs/margins because they are craft.\n\nNo, they justify it by producing better beer. You're making the same mistake that large breweries make when they try and 'capture the craft segment' by pumping out boring beers with flashy, indie marketing. The majority of people don't buy craft beer because they want to seem cool or because they want to support small business. They buy it because the beer tastes better. If CUB put out great beer that I enjoyed drinking then I'd buy it, as would many others.\n\nAs I said, I've been really really wanting to buy Fat Yak lately to bring to parties, because it's cheap, tasty, and the cans are convenient.

That's starting to change, but the major OEMs are still extremely dependent on the US carriers for distributing their devices, and for that reason they have a fair bit of sway.\nSo until we break out of this ridiculous carrier controlled, 2 year contract model, the carriers have the reins. And they want you to upgrade every 2 years, if not sooner. So as soon as you bring out a phone that means you can potentially upgrade parts of it, slowly and outside of their control, they're going to freak out.\n\nSecondly, the carriers have certification processes that makes sure devices work properly on their network. Now this is mostly bullshit, but they insist on doing it. So now instead of having 10 devices to certify, you've got 20,000 different combinations of parts that all have to be certified. Perhaps you could just certify all the different cell radios and ignore the other bits, but I suspect the carriers won't see it that way. It's not worth their while to allow devices on their network that interfere with other users, so they're going to make doubly sure that they check every single combination of devices.\n\nThirdly, an upgradeable phone is a bad deal for manufacturers as well. They also want to sell you a new phone every 2 years, so it's not in their best interests to let you upgrade your device. Also, allowing you to choose parts for your smartphone allows for greater diversification. There's really only a handful of big players producing processors, radios and chipsets (Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia) and lowering the barrier to entry means less money in the incumbent's pockets.\n\nLastly, there's the matter of actually fitting all of the parts in there. The reason you can't already just upgrade parts of phones, is because every time an OEM designs a new phone they basically have to play a game of tetris in order to fit all the parts inside the phone without making it huge. So as soon as you start letting users do this, phones are really going to become gigantic. It's not a huge problem, but it's just another roadblock.\n\nIt's basically what the PC market is today. But it's got a bunch of things in the way of it working, and it's going to need a gigantic shift in two separate industries to work.\n\n**tl;dr** Carriers are going to hate this because it gives them less control, carrier certification will be an absolute nightmare with 20,000 different hardware skews, manufacturers are going to hate it because it means there's opportunity for smaller players to get a slice of the action, as well as less incentive to upgrade.

And since iPhone = iOS, iPhone users are much more aware of what they're using, even if they still look at you funny when you mention iOS (instead of calling it iPhone). On the other hand, Android users might not know that they're using Android, simply because Android is not synonymous with a particular product like iOS is.\n\nIt's the same concept as Mac and PC. If you have a Mac, you're running OSX, but if you have a PC, your PC may be manufactured by Dell or HP or any number of other manufacturers, but you're running Windows in the end. (I'm leaving out linux because it doesn't really fit, as most of the time, if you're running linux, you know it). People are more aware of Windows and OSX because of the marketing campaigns that have gone on, but even so, a lot of the time people wont identify strongly as windows users, where as they will identify strongly as mac users (ie. OSX users).\n\nOf course, the part that I'm neglecting is the way in which Apple have done a brilliant job of marketing themselves, which is a large part of why Apple users know that they're Apple users.

Apple have done great things, and I definitely agree that they're forcing Google to up the ante. But really, I quite enjoy Apple hate when it's legitimate and well thought out, instead of a childish pissing competition.\n\nThe reason that I think Apple is a problem is that they're essentially screwing over consumers who don't know any better. It's like feeding a dog shitty food because he doesn't know any better. He's still going to eat it up and love you for it (he's a dog, after all) but it's not as nice as giving him A grade beef for dinner, which will make him healthier and happier.\n\nApple continues to stop consumers from doing what they want with their phone. The remark I constantly hear is that only nerds want to do the cool stuff that Android allows you to do, but I think that's a flawed argument. The issue is that consumers don't realize the power that Android affords them over iOS, and that is all to do with Google's lack of marketing. Google needs to put out an ad campaign similar to Apples Mac vc PC ads, so that users can smarten up and realize that Android is just as cool, just as fun, and much more powerful than iOS.\n\nSorry for the long ramble. I think I just need to vent my thoughts occasionally. In summary, I don't really hate Apple, I just think that what they do is backwards and overall, bad for consumers. Apple hate is alright, as long as it's not irrational, emotional hate, but instead is grounded in reason and logic."}

It's something that Apple simply doesn't have to deal with, because the only company making iOS devices is Apple.

It would have a similar effect to Apples marketing, I feel, because at the end of the day, the hardware is a means to an end, and that end is running Android.

If it were closed and Samsung were having to reverse engineer it or essentially copy it to make their phones, they would have been sued out of existence. Yes, there are some shitty Chinese OEMs pumping out cheap, garbage phones. Has this tarnished Android's reputation?

I can make 20L of homebrew for about $50 of raw materials, so you'd have to assume breweries with their larger scale could do a bit better. Let's say it's $1.25/L. \n\nBottles at Grain and Grape are $15 for 25 330ml bottles, so that comes out to $1.8/L, so lets say $1.5/L for a largish brewery.\n\nThat's already $4.40/L, and my estimates there of the discount due to purchasing in bulk are probably pretty generous.. Add to that labels, caps, bottling equipment, mash and lauter vessels, water, electricity, cleaning products, storage tanks, costs of renting or leasing a building, marketing and probably a million other things.\n\nThese breweries aren't lining their pockets at your expense. They're small, which means the economies of scale don't favour them as much as the gigantic breweries. For example, Bridge Road has a 2500 litre brewhouse, which means that's what they can produce in one brew. I'm not sure how many they do a day, but I suspect 2 or 3 would be stretching it. CUB's Melbourne brewery alone produces 2 million litres a day.\n\nSo basically, don't be a fool. If you don't want to pay for craft beer, then feel free to enjoy whatever cheap beer you like. If you enjoy it, that's what matters. But don't kid yourself into thinking that craft beer producers have gigantic margins on their product, because it's simply not true.

Only beyond that will you start to get off flavours from the yeast cells autolysing (basically dying by splitting open).\n\nI've been leaving my beers in primary for 3 weeks before bottling.
